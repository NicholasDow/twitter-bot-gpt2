"Hey guys Brandon‚Äôs case is even more urgent, he‚Äôs actually scheduled to be executed on December 10th not the 12th"
#HelpSaveBrandon
Juror JF speaking out on Brandon‚Äôs Case #HelpSaveBrandon
Juror GM speaking out on Brandon‚Äôs Case #HelpSaveBrandon
Op-ed: I helped put Brandon Bernard on federal death row. I now think he should live.
"HOW YOU CAN HELP For more info about the case &amp; to let President Trump know that you think Brandon's death sentence is unjust, please visit   &amp; add your name to the letter asking that Brandon's death sentence is commuted to life imprisonment #HelpSaveBrandon"
"He has now been on death row for 20+ years with zero disciplinary write ups. He uses his time to reach out to at-risk youth, advising them to not stray from the Lord's path (or not follow in his teenage footsteps)."
"Although all five teens were black, 11 of the 12 jurors were white. This, coupled with the misleading and incomplete information the jury was given, deprived the boys of a fair trial.  Instead of being executed, Brandon could live outhis sentence in prison."
Recently the prosecutor herself- the person who helped put Brandon on death row- has also come forward and asked that his life be spared since he was the least culpable of the five teens involved.
"In fact, two jurors who have since stated that had they learned about Brandon's background or how at just a few months past 18 his brain was still developing, they would NOT have voted for the death penalty."
or how his homeless father had left him searching for protection in the streets.  His trial attorney also failed to tell the jury how remorsefulhe was or anythingabout his background. We now know this testimony would have spared his life.
"At trial Brandon's attorney fell short by nothiring any experts who could have explained to the jury why Brandon decidedto leave the video game store that night or how he had grown up in an abusive home,"
"The gunman then turned to Brandon, gun still in hand, and told him to light the car Todd and Stacie lay in on fire to destroy the evidence. Brandon believed both were dead, though Stacie was not, and was fearful for his own life, so he made the terrible decision to comply."
"In fact, Brandon was not a part of the initial carjacking that took place and was stunned when the robbery turned into a homicide with one of the other teens shooting both Todd and Stacie in the head."
"While Brandon did participate in this crime, his role was minor compared to that of the other teens involved,two of whom are home from prison now."
"First, I want to say that a terrible crime was committedand me fighting for a stay of execution does not take away from the sympathy I have for the victim's Todd and Stacie Bagley, and their families. My heart breaks for everyone involved."
"A terrible case has been brought to my attention and I need your help. Without it, on December 12th Brandon Bernard is going to be executed for a crime he participated in as a teenager."

Then as I entered in the room I ended up at my second birthday then my fourth birthday leading up to my 10th birthday where my sisters did the same exact dance that they did for me when I turned 10.
"My dad video taped and documented our whole lives so they showed each of the videos of my birthdays on a big screen behind the party. I entered into the room that started off at my first birthday party with the same ponies and the same cake, and my dad wishing me a happy 1st bday"
"You know I‚Äôm a sentimental person and this party was the most special. They re-created all of my special birthdays throughout my life from looking at all of our old home videos. They re-created the party, The same balloons, the same cake, everything!"
All I can say is WOW! My mom and my sisters threw me the most epic surprise party that was so special in my heart. We showed it on E as a special so you guys got to see the behind the scenes of how it really went down.

My heart goes out to the family of Steve Thomas. I can only imagine how hard this is and my intention is never to open up this painful wound but to help find the truth behind this tragedy.
"Today I‚Äôm teaming up with @MonicaDenise, @JessicaJackson and @EdyHaney to #FreeCoreyMiller"
True justice for the young man requires that the person who actually killed him be held responsible and that Corey Miller he returned home to his kids.
"Since his trial, witnesses have recanted, new evidence of his potential innocence has come to light, and there are claims of jurors being pressured into voting to convict."
"The jury convicted Corey 10-2 and he was sentenced him to life in prison. If his trial was today, the jury would have had to be unanimous for him to be convicted."
"#FreeCoreyMiller  On January 18, 2002 a tragedy occurred when a young man was killed. The next day Corey Miller was arrested for the murder."

Ways You Can Help
"Text ""FLOYD"" to 55156 #BlackLivesMatters #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd #JusticeforAhmaudArbery #JusticeforBreonnaTaylor"
"Even though I will never know the pain and suffering they have endured, or what it feels like to try to survive in a world plagued by systemic racism, I know I can use my own voice to help amplify those voices that have been muffled for too long."
"I am exhausted by the heartbreak I feel seeing mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers and children suffering because their loved one was murdered or locked away unjustly for being black."
"But the privilege I am afforded by the color of my skin has often left me feeling like this is not a fight that I can truly take on as my own. Not today, not anymore. Like so many of you, I am angry. I am more than angry. I am infuriated and I am disgusted."
"For years, with every horrific murder of an innocent black man, woman, or child, I have always tried to find the right words to express my condolences and outrage"

"This will be the last time I speak on this because honestly, nobody cares.   Sorry to bore you all with this. I know you are all dealing with more serious and important matters."
"Kanye has documented the making of all of his albums for his personal archive, however has never released any of it for public consumption &amp; the call between the two of them would have remained private or would have gone in the trash had she not lied &amp; forced me to defend him."
"To add, Kanye as an artist has every right to document his musical journey and process, just like she recently did through her documentary."
I never edited the footage (another lie) - I only posted a few clips on Snapchat to make my point and the full video that recently leaked doesn‚Äôt change the narrative.
"‚Äúdeclined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message.‚Äù  The lie was never about the word bitch, It was always whether there was a call or not and the tone of the conversation."
"At the time when they spoke the song had not been fully written yet, but as everyone can see in the video, she manipulated the truth of their actual conversation in her statement when her team said she"
"To be clear, the only issue I ever had around the situation was that Taylor lied through her publicist who stated that ‚ÄúKanye never called to ask for permission...‚Äù They clearly spoke so I let you all see that. Nobody ever denied the word ‚Äúbitch‚Äù was used without her permission."
"I didn‚Äôt feel the need to comment a few days ago, and I‚Äôm actually really embarrassed and mortified to be doing it right now, but because she continues to speak on it, I feel I‚Äôm left without a choice but to respond because she is actually lying."
.@taylorswift13 has chosen to reignite an old exchange - that at this point in time feels very self-serving given the suffering millions of real victims are facing right now.

RIP Nathaniel Woods üïä
Nate will die for a crime another man confessed to and says Nate had nothing to do with. My heart and prayers are with Nate and his family and all the advocates who worked tirelessly to save his life.
The court has lifted the temporary stay of execution for #NathanielWoods. The governor will NOT save his life. My heart and prayers are with Nate and his family.  This is a tragic example of injustice in the system- in a few minutes Nate may die for a crime he did not commit.

White House here we come!!!
"Today Alice, Crystal, Judith, Tynice and I, along with the @cut_50 team will be at the White House bringing light to these women and discuss more change that our justice system desperately needs!"
How amazing is @AliceMarieFree for being so involved and now helping to free other women!!!!
Tynice rehabilitated herself and prepared for a future outside of prison by completing numerous classes and becoming certified in various trades.
Tynice Hall was sentenced to 35 years in prison for a first time non violent drug conspiracy. Her boyfriend at the time used her house for his illegal drug activities. She was only 22 years old when she went to prison and left behind a 3 year old son.
Wardens and staff alike spoke glowingly of the incredible contributions Judith made to the prison while incarcerated.
"Judith Negron was sentenced to 35 years in prison for conspiracy to commit health care fraud. After trial she received the longest sentence ever given to a female for a white collar crime. A mother, she left behind two young sons. This was Judith‚Äôs first ever offense."
Crystal case was highlighted in the First Step Act which banned the degrading and inhumane treatment of shackling female prisoners during childbirth.
Crystal Munoz was sentenced to 20 years in prison for conspiracy to posses &amp; distribute marijuana. She left behind a five month old baby &amp; was pregnant. Crystal was shackled by prison guards during the birth of her second daughter. Her case was highlighted in the First Step Act.
President Trump commuted the sentences of three really deserving women. I didn‚Äôt hear much about it in the news so I wanted to share with you their stores! I have the pleasure of spending the day with these women today along with @AliceMarieFree who helped to pick these women

"So grateful for the commitment and passion of everyone who voiced their support, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles for their recommendation to issue a 120 day reprieve, and the courts for issuing a stay!"
We have heard people all around the globe speak up. And all because of a deep belief that every man or woman accused of a crime - especially one punishable by death - deserves the chance to have all available evidence considered.
Words cannot describe the relief and hope that swept over the room in that moment. That hope had been building over the last few weeks around Rodney‚Äôs case. We have seen Democrats and Republicans come together. We have seen grassroots activists and lawmakers link arms.
"Today, I had the honor of meeting #RodneyReed in person and the privilege of sitting with him when he got the news that the highest court in Texas had issued a stay of execution and remanded the case back to the trial court for further consideration."
Be sure to join the waitlist at   to be the first to shop when the collection drops!

"After the name change, we wanted to make sure we didn‚Äôt waste any of the original @skims product, so we tried and tested hundreds of different approaches to remove the old branding to ensure we saved it all."
"HBD to @makeupbymario‚Äôs mom today, without her I wouldn‚Äôt be who I am today without Mario!  This is a typical glam session with Mario &amp; I. Me on my phone, him laser focused &amp; us testing out new formula  &amp; colors. (Not our final palette) KKW X MARIO The Artist and The Muse Nov 22"

Even do it for 30 or 40 seconds and it‚Äôs a dream!
FYI for the @skims Body Tape you can use other colors other than your skin tone. It also depends on the color of your dress or top if it will photograph underneath. You want to match the color of your clothes if it is slightly sheer.
You have to try it! Warm melted chocolate inside and the hard crunchy shell on the outside

"I‚Äôve watched him grow from a talented young artist who slowly and respectfully worked his way up through the years in the the old fashioned way, never expecting short cuts and always putting his work and others first."
"For over 11 years, Mario and I have worked together and created some incredible glam moments. I‚Äôm so excited to finally announce our 2nd collaboration together. I‚Äôve watched him work passionately for the past year on this collection and campaign."
Such a good read. Everyone should read this entire thread from a journalist who has followed this case for 18 years!

"This was the most special, nostalgic day of my life and we felt my dad‚Äôs presence enjoying this day with us!  I kept it together at lunch even though I cried during the planning process. But at the end I went into my old bathroom, closed the door &amp; cried so hard."
I even remade the exact license plates. (Yes my mom had a 2 DIE 4 license plate!) We drove to the home in these cars and relived our childhood! This was the best day ever. I am so proud I was able to keep such a meaningful surprise a secret from my mom and sisters for weeks!
I had some waiting outside so we could drive them to the house and the rest were lined up in the driveway of the house exactly how my parents used to have them parked.
"We had lunch at the home as if it hadn‚Äôt changed and we cried the entire time. When we walked out to get our cars to drive there, I had another surprise! I had rented every car my parents ever owned."
"All of our memories live here especially with our dad. It‚Äôs where each Kardashian child was born &amp; made us who we are. Growing up, the home had the most ridiculous wallpaper &amp; kitchen set! I remade all of our table settings out of the same fabric &amp; print as the wallpaper."
I then gave everyone the REAL invitation and once everyone saw the address for where we would be going tears filled the room. I rented our childhood home.
"For her birthday I planned a small lunch, with just her kids and her closest friends of 40 + years. I sent out invites with a location where we all met. When everyone arrived, I told them I had a surprise and this wasn‚Äôt where we would be eating."
"Today we celebrate my mom. Anyone that knows her, knows how sentimental she is."
"Join me, @KourtneyKardash and @KhloeKardashian as we sit down with our friends @TheRealDaytime today and talk about our new @KKWFragrance! Check your local listings!"
You‚Äôve given us the tools to be the best we can be and have taught us that kindness rules the world!  I can‚Äôt wait to celebrate you today! I love you so much! Happy Birthday @KrisJenner
"Today is your day! You are the best mom in the entire world. I don‚Äôt know how you do it! Seriously my love and respect for you grows every single day seeing how you  manage to take care of 6 kids, a million grand kids and make everyone feel so loved and special."

If you let it dry before putting your clothes on it transfers way less &amp; if you set it with a translucent powder it hardly transfers at all. It was important to keep the skin looking flawless yet natural. We didn‚Äôt have translucent powder but tried pressed powder which worked too
Let‚Äôs talk about the transfer. I‚Äôve been using body makeup for over a decade &amp; in my experience you either get coverage that doesn‚Äôt transfer but it‚Äôs super dry and looks fake or it‚Äôs the opposite and really moisturizing but completely transfers. My new body makeup is in between.
My grandma MJ asked me about my @kkwbeauty Body Makeup and wanted me to come over to help cover her veins. North &amp; I went straight to her house &amp; showed her exactly how to use it &amp; I love how happy she is with the results! How amazing is this before and after on MJ?!

Year 5-2017 Vivienne Westwood.  This was my first year going solo. I was so nervous to go by myself I almost threw up on the way &amp; I had to pee every second.. I was FaceTiming my sisters to meet up at the top of the stairs. Vivienne made me this beautiful dress from her archive.
Year 4- 2016 Olivier Rousteing for Balmain. I was back to insecure this year because I hadn‚Äôt lost all of my baby weight. Big mistake to bleach the brows but Kanye looked so good this year with those blue eyes! It was super controversial that he wore denim.
Year 3-2015 Peter Dundas for Roberto Cavalli. This is his first dress designing for Cavalli. I was 2 months Pregnant with Saint &amp; desperately trying to hide it. I felt so confident this year! I had more of an opinion and collaborated so well. I really felt so good this night.
"Year 2- 2014 Alber Elbaz for Lanvin. I was invited on my own this year! We just had our Vogue cover &amp; Alber gave me the dress I wore on the cover so Anna suggested I wear Lanvin. Not sure why we picked blue lol. Following our cover, this is a dream."
Year 1- 2013 Riccardo Tisci for Givenchy. I was Kanye‚Äôs plus one &amp; so nervous! I didn‚Äôt know anyone &amp;  I‚Äôm sure no one wanted me there lol.  I did my own lipstick &amp; the color is so off. I went home &amp; cried after of insecurity but this is one of my fave looks now.

And we should not be okay with the risk that an innocent person could be executed. I hope we can turn toward better solutions that focus more on healing victims of trauma and prioritizing fairness and justice.
I have met with and am very supportive of Governor Newsom and his decision to help bring an end to the California Death Penalty. Racial bias and unfairness run deep throughout the justice system but especially when it comes to the death penalty.
"For the last year, I have immersed myself in learning about the criminal justice system. I visited prisons, met with formerly incarcerated people, and helped with cases of individual injustice - including two death penalty cases."

"So, as always, don‚Äôt believe everything you read and see online. I don‚Äôt have any relationships with these sites. I‚Äôm not leaking my looks to anyone, and I don‚Äôt support what these companies are doing."
"I often plan for weeks, sometimes months, and even a year in advance, and I‚Äôm grateful for every fashion moment those designers and their dresses have helped me create."
My relationships with designers are very important to me. It's taken me over a decade to build them and I have a huge amount of respect for the amount of work that they put into bringing their ideas to life.
This is a way to get people to sign up for their mailing list and make people believe there is some kind of relationship between me and this fashion site. There is not.
"Only two days ago, I was privileged enough to wear a one-of-a-kind vintage Mugler dress and in less than 24 hours it was knocked off and thrown up on a site - but it's not for sale. You have to sign up for a waitlist because the dress hasn‚Äôt even been made to sell yet."
"I‚Äôve watched these companies profit off my husband‚Äôs work for years and now that it‚Äôs also affecting designers who have been so generous to give me access to their beautiful works, I can no longer sit silent."
"It‚Äôs devastating to see these fashion companies rip off designs that have taken the blood, sweat and tears of true designers who have put their all into their own original ideas."
We lost a true legend! You were such an inspiration to the world! You shot my first fashion shoot &amp; I was so nervous to work w such an icon! The world is so much chicer because u existed! I‚Äôm beyond honored to have had the opportunity to work w u. U are so loved &amp; will be missed

I have and will always applaud any efforts to give back to the community. To fight for justice and to help uplift the youth. But I will never tolerate someone who was close to Kanye who attempts to use his late mother‚Äôs name to publicly shame him while pretending to do good.
"Kanye gave his ‚Äúfriend‚Äù an opportunity to run an organization on his own. So now that Kanye is being publicly shamed for not being involved makes no sense and,  at this exact time, just seems very calculated."
"After several years of lack of performance from the organization and Kanye going through personal financial issues, he could no longer fund salaries. Rhymefest asked to take it over and Kanye agreed with no financial strings attached."
"Kanye and Donda started  a charity called Loop Dreams. When Donda passed, they changed the name to Donda‚Äôs House. Kanye paid Rhymefest a salary to run it."

Mental Health is no joke and the media needs to stop spitting that out so casually. Bottom line
Kanye will never run in the race of popular opinion and we know that and that‚Äôs why I love him and respect him and in a few years when someone else says the same exact thing but they aren‚Äôt labeled the way he is  and you will all praise them! Kanye is years ahead of his time
"Now when he spoke out about Trump... Most people (including myself) have very different feelings &amp; opinions about this. But this is HIS opinion.  I believe in people being able to have their own opinions,even if really different from mine He never said he agrees with his politics"
"He‚Äôs a free thinker, is that not allowed in America? Because some of his ideas differ from yours you have to throw in the mental health card? That‚Äôs just not fair. He‚Äôs actually out of the sunken place when he‚Äôs being himself which is very expressive"
Yesterday it was announced that Kanye had parted ways with some business people and media outlets made this about Kanye‚Äôs mental health. Rather than just a simple business decision. So I‚Äôm glad he tweeted about the state of his company and all of the exciting things happening
To the media trying to demonize my husband let me just say this... your commentary on Kanye being erratic &amp; his tweets being disturbing is actually scary. So quick to label him as having mental health issues for just being himself when he has always been expressive is not fair

When I uploaded the album I was tagging everyone that came to the party and for some reason it wouldn‚Äôt let me tag Jackie‚Äôs name.
I would never post someone‚Äôs pic on my page and then intentionally not tag them.

The fact that anyone can so easily access guns is so scary &amp; after all of the devastating loss the Senate should have not failed us!!!
Oh &amp; mentally ill people can buy guns without a background check too.
So sad! The senate voted against background checks being needed to buy guns. So terrorists on fbi's wanted lists can legally still buy guns

You should google Kerry Max Cook his story is fascinating and heart breaking #RightThisWrong
This will now prevent him from receiving the compensation he deserves for the decades he spent on death row.
These are the types of media stories I  Google when I can't sleep
"Wait prosecutors agreed to drop the murder charges, but they will continue to oppose Cook‚Äôs claims of actual innocence. Always a hang up!"
His chargers were just dropped after DNA evidence was finally brought in and cleared him. Can u imagine being wrongly imprisoned for 40 yrs
Just read the story of Kerry Max Cook. He had been on death row for a murder he didn't commit for almost 40 years.

My Instagram is definitely my expression and what I love to show the world. My snap is kinda my silly sarcastic alter ego
"Buuuut if you are following me, do you like my snaps? I feel like everyone has a snap personality"
Are you guys following me on snap? LOL I'm not telling u to follow me lol since I hate when people tell me who to follow
Or who to follow!!! It's my eyes looking at all the posts. How can someone tell me what to look at!

If u only saw Northie's reaction! As a mom I got protective and left that scary moment out of the episode for her privacy
But as a mother this as the scariest things that could have happened w your child in the car. Khloe handled it so well!
The crash was so scary &amp; the way it was edited doesn't even do it justice! I keep North out of the show so we had to cut around that footage
I don't even know why I started crying after! Just so happy everyone is ok! Scariest experience of my life!
I honestly couldn't believe we had car cams on when that happened!!!!! How scary was that seriously!!!!!!!!! I always wear my seat belt now!
Seriously I'm so lucky to have a friend like @psychicmediumje he gives the best advice and the truth!!! No matter what! Had to call him up!

wish me luck on the dieting...its soooo hard for me!
ok no more tweeting and procrastinating! LOL Glad some of u moms can relate. I'm reading the comments! For real....of to the gym!
i think after having a baby u get so excited u lost a lot of weight then u get comfortable &amp; eat how you used &amp; it creeps back up.
Just need to get down to my weight a few years ago. Not gonna complain anymore. Starting diet TODAY! No carbs. crazy workouts. Whos with me?
do any of u moms see their bodies just not the same? a different shape? ughhhh my hips &amp; butt are huge now! they were big to begin with!
I'm not gonna call it baby weight bc thats an excuse. i just gained weight &amp; that's it. why is it so much harder to lose after baby though!!
off to an intense workout. Can't seem to shake this last 15-20 lbs of baby weight. no more excuses. my baby is 1 years old! UGH
