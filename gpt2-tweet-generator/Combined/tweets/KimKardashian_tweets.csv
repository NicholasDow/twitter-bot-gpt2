"Hey guys Brandon’s case is even more urgent, he’s actually scheduled to be executed on December 10th not the 12th"
#HelpSaveBrandon
Juror JF speaking out on Brandon’s Case #HelpSaveBrandon
Juror GM speaking out on Brandon’s Case #HelpSaveBrandon
Op-ed: I helped put Brandon Bernard on federal death row. I now think he should live.
"HOW YOU CAN HELP For more info about the case &amp; to let President Trump know that you think Brandon's death sentence is unjust, please visit   &amp; add your name to the letter asking that Brandon's death sentence is commuted to life imprisonment #HelpSaveBrandon"
"He has now been on death row for 20+ years with zero disciplinary write ups. He uses his time to reach out to at-risk youth, advising them to not stray from the Lord's path (or not follow in his teenage footsteps)."
"Although all five teens were black, 11 of the 12 jurors were white. This, coupled with the misleading and incomplete information the jury was given, deprived the boys of a fair trial.  Instead of being executed, Brandon could live outhis sentence in prison."
Recently the prosecutor herself- the person who helped put Brandon on death row- has also come forward and asked that his life be spared since he was the least culpable of the five teens involved.
"In fact, two jurors who have since stated that had they learned about Brandon's background or how at just a few months past 18 his brain was still developing, they would NOT have voted for the death penalty."
or how his homeless father had left him searching for protection in the streets.  His trial attorney also failed to tell the jury how remorsefulhe was or anythingabout his background. We now know this testimony would have spared his life.
"At trial Brandon's attorney fell short by nothiring any experts who could have explained to the jury why Brandon decidedto leave the video game store that night or how he had grown up in an abusive home,"
"The gunman then turned to Brandon, gun still in hand, and told him to light the car Todd and Stacie lay in on fire to destroy the evidence. Brandon believed both were dead, though Stacie was not, and was fearful for his own life, so he made the terrible decision to comply."
"In fact, Brandon was not a part of the initial carjacking that took place and was stunned when the robbery turned into a homicide with one of the other teens shooting both Todd and Stacie in the head."
"While Brandon did participate in this crime, his role was minor compared to that of the other teens involved,two of whom are home from prison now."
"First, I want to say that a terrible crime was committedand me fighting for a stay of execution does not take away from the sympathy I have for the victim's Todd and Stacie Bagley, and their families. My heart breaks for everyone involved."
"A terrible case has been brought to my attention and I need your help. Without it, on December 12th Brandon Bernard is going to be executed for a crime he participated in as a teenager."

"I love the feedback we have been receiving from our bigger vials of the nude glosses, so we’re also relaunching our concealers in bigger vials and introducing four new shades to our KKW Concealer collection!"
"Our new corrector collection comes in four peach and orange hued shades that work to eliminate that darker under-eye color. This is my first step in my concealer routine no matter what kind of look I’m going for, I really can’t do glam without it."
"I’m excited to announce that we’re relaunching our @kkwbeauty Concealer Kits with an added first step: Correct, Conceal, Bake and Brighten! I have dark under-eye circles that can get really blue and purple when I’m tired, so my secret weapon to cover them up is with a corrector."

"After 2 weeks of multiple health screens and asking everyone to quarantine, I surprised my closest inner circle with a trip to a private island where we could pretend things were normal just for a brief moment in time."
"Before COVID, I don’t think any of us truly appreciated what a simple luxury it was to be able to travel and be together with family and friends in a safe environment."
"For my birthday this year, I couldn’t think of a better way to spend it than with some of the people who have helped shaped me into the woman I am today."

I can’t wait to share so many more birthday photos and videos with you guys soon and I thank each and everyone of you who reached out with birthday wishes ✨
I spent all of my 30s having my birthday parties. Each and every detail that went into this was so special and I am forever grateful to my family for taking the time to put this together to celebrate me turning 40.
"We then got to my 16th birthday party and my exact same car was there waiting for me with the same exact balloons with the same cake. After a while the curtains opened and the bottle service girls came out which happened to be my sisters and they re-created Tao night club, where"
Then as I entered in the room I ended up at my second birthday then my fourth birthday leading up to my 10th birthday where my sisters did the same exact dance that they did for me when I turned 10.
"My dad video taped and documented our whole lives so they showed each of the videos of my birthdays on a big screen behind the party. I entered into the room that started off at my first birthday party with the same ponies and the same cake, and my dad wishing me a happy 1st bday"
"You know I’m a sentimental person and this party was the most special. They re-created all of my special birthdays throughout my life from looking at all of our old home videos. They re-created the party, The same balloons, the same cake, everything!"
All I can say is WOW! My mom and my sisters threw me the most epic surprise party that was so special in my heart. We showed it on E as a special so you guys got to see the behind the scenes of how it really went down.

My heart goes out to the family of Steve Thomas. I can only imagine how hard this is and my intention is never to open up this painful wound but to help find the truth behind this tragedy.
"Today I’m teaming up with @MonicaDenise, @JessicaJackson and @EdyHaney to #FreeCoreyMiller"
True justice for the young man requires that the person who actually killed him be held responsible and that Corey Miller he returned home to his kids.
"Since his trial, witnesses have recanted, new evidence of his potential innocence has come to light, and there are claims of jurors being pressured into voting to convict."
"The jury convicted Corey 10-2 and he was sentenced him to life in prison. If his trial was today, the jury would have had to be unanimous for him to be convicted."
"#FreeCoreyMiller  On January 18, 2002 a tragedy occurred when a young man was killed. The next day Corey Miller was arrested for the murder."

"Last week, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine commuted the sentence of #AlexisMartin.  I met Alexis last year and have been actively following her case. Thank you to her lawyers and the nonprofit @ohiojpc who fought tirelessly for her freedom. I love seeing these pics of Alexis!"
"As a 15-year-old survivor of sex trafficking, Alexis Martin needed resources and advocacy–not a sentence in adult prison. Alexis is finally free today because of generous pro bono lawyers and staff from the @ohiojpc. Thank you for all that you do."
The best thing I’ve been doing is organizing all of the pictures in my phone and making folders for each of my children.
The police rushed to judgment when they arrested Kevin. This innocent man went from living freely to having his world upended by a murder trial to death row in under 4 months. That's more than enough injustice for one person. OH needs to correct its mistake before it's too late.
"This is not OK. Kevin Keith survived 10 yrs on death row for a crime he didn’t commit, only to find himself under threat of death again, trapped in a prison that has become the leading hotspot for COVID-19. PLEASE HELP"

"This will be the last time I speak on this because honestly, nobody cares.   Sorry to bore you all with this. I know you are all dealing with more serious and important matters."
"Kanye has documented the making of all of his albums for his personal archive, however has never released any of it for public consumption &amp; the call between the two of them would have remained private or would have gone in the trash had she not lied &amp; forced me to defend him."
"To add, Kanye as an artist has every right to document his musical journey and process, just like she recently did through her documentary."
I never edited the footage (another lie) - I only posted a few clips on Snapchat to make my point and the full video that recently leaked doesn’t change the narrative.
"“declined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message.”  The lie was never about the word bitch, It was always whether there was a call or not and the tone of the conversation."
"At the time when they spoke the song had not been fully written yet, but as everyone can see in the video, she manipulated the truth of their actual conversation in her statement when her team said she"
"To be clear, the only issue I ever had around the situation was that Taylor lied through her publicist who stated that “Kanye never called to ask for permission...” They clearly spoke so I let you all see that. Nobody ever denied the word “bitch” was used without her permission."
"I didn’t feel the need to comment a few days ago, and I’m actually really embarrassed and mortified to be doing it right now, but because she continues to speak on it, I feel I’m left without a choice but to respond because she is actually lying."
.@taylorswift13 has chosen to reignite an old exchange - that at this point in time feels very self-serving given the suffering millions of real victims are facing right now.

RIP Nathaniel Woods 🕊
Nate will die for a crime another man confessed to and says Nate had nothing to do with. My heart and prayers are with Nate and his family and all the advocates who worked tirelessly to save his life.
The court has lifted the temporary stay of execution for #NathanielWoods. The governor will NOT save his life. My heart and prayers are with Nate and his family.  This is a tragic example of injustice in the system- in a few minutes Nate may die for a crime he did not commit.

Alright @KendallJenner and @lala got me to watch Love Is Blind and I’m obsessed!!!!!!!!!
Omg! She is so cute!!! 💕💕💕
White House here we come!!!
"Today Alice, Crystal, Judith, Tynice and I, along with the @cut_50 team will be at the White House bringing light to these women and discuss more change that our justice system desperately needs!"
How amazing is @AliceMarieFree for being so involved and now helping to free other women!!!!
Tynice rehabilitated herself and prepared for a future outside of prison by completing numerous classes and becoming certified in various trades.
Tynice Hall was sentenced to 35 years in prison for a first time non violent drug conspiracy. Her boyfriend at the time used her house for his illegal drug activities. She was only 22 years old when she went to prison and left behind a 3 year old son.
Wardens and staff alike spoke glowingly of the incredible contributions Judith made to the prison while incarcerated.
"Judith Negron was sentenced to 35 years in prison for conspiracy to commit health care fraud. After trial she received the longest sentence ever given to a female for a white collar crime. A mother, she left behind two young sons. This was Judith’s first ever offense."
Crystal case was highlighted in the First Step Act which banned the degrading and inhumane treatment of shackling female prisoners during childbirth.
Crystal Munoz was sentenced to 20 years in prison for conspiracy to posses &amp; distribute marijuana. She left behind a five month old baby &amp; was pregnant. Crystal was shackled by prison guards during the birth of her second daughter. Her case was highlighted in the First Step Act.
President Trump commuted the sentences of three really deserving women. I didn’t hear much about it in the news so I wanted to share with you their stores! I have the pleasure of spending the day with these women today along with @AliceMarieFree who helped to pick these women

"After last night’s episode, we received an outpouring of interest in the clean up of the Santa Susana Field Lab. The moms fighting to protect their kids need your help: click to send a message to @NASA demanding a FULL cleanup:"
"On this week's episode we met with Melissa Bumstead, who is fighting to clean up a toxic site which she believes gave her daughter cancer. She's one of several parents who need your help pressuring @NASA to clean up the site:"
NASA is attempting to break out of its cleanup agreement and leave most of its contamination not cleaned up. The public can weigh in on their plan by sending in comments to NASA by December 9.
The timing of our Keeping Up With The Kardashians episode last night talking about Santa Susana is synergistic. NASA has agreed legally to pay for the clean up knowing this was their test sight where they would test rockets but is now trying to back out
I have that rock from Gracie in my kitchen #KUWTK
The Santa Susana Field Lab stories are so heart breaking 💔 To this day NOTHING has been done to start this clean up!

I love seeing all of the content and doing shoots with him #KKWXMARIO
We love working together that we wanted to do it again. #KKWXMARIO
When it comes to a collab with @MakeupByMario he’s such a perfectionist and just THE BEST at picking formulas and colors that I left him take over. So maybe just the time it takes to create something that’s from his heart

"So grateful for the commitment and passion of everyone who voiced their support, the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles for their recommendation to issue a 120 day reprieve, and the courts for issuing a stay!"
We have heard people all around the globe speak up. And all because of a deep belief that every man or woman accused of a crime - especially one punishable by death - deserves the chance to have all available evidence considered.
Words cannot describe the relief and hope that swept over the room in that moment. That hope had been building over the last few weeks around Rodney’s case. We have seen Democrats and Republicans come together. We have seen grassroots activists and lawmakers link arms.
"Today, I had the honor of meeting #RodneyReed in person and the privilege of sitting with him when he got the news that the highest court in Texas had issued a stay of execution and remanded the case back to the trial court for further consideration."
Be sure to join the waitlist at   to be the first to shop when the collection drops!
"These are the original pieces we’re bringing back on November 20th, which will feature a super soft fabric SKIMS label! We’ll also be introducing 4 new @skims Solutionwear™ styles based on your comments and requests since we launched that I can’t wait to show you."
"After the name change, we wanted to make sure we didn’t waste any of the original @skims product, so we tried and tested hundreds of different approaches to remove the old branding to ensure we saved it all."
"HBD to @makeupbymario’s mom today, without her I wouldn’t be who I am today without Mario!  This is a typical glam session with Mario &amp; I. Me on my phone, him laser focused &amp; us testing out new formula  &amp; colors. (Not our final palette) KKW X MARIO The Artist and The Muse Nov 22"

Check my earlier tweets from yesterday I shared pics from all styles wearing one shoulder tops and dresses
Even do it for 30 or 40 seconds and it’s a dream!
FYI for the @skims Body Tape you can use other colors other than your skin tone. It also depends on the color of your dress or top if it will photograph underneath. You want to match the color of your clothes if it is slightly sheer.
You have to try it! Warm melted chocolate inside and the hard crunchy shell on the outside
Thank you! I know you will live it! It launches tomorrow

"He values hard work and is loyal  to the core. never one to follow trends, he’s become a trailblazer, pioneer, educator and an inspiration to artists around the world."
"I’ve watched him grow from a talented young artist who slowly and respectfully worked his way up through the years in the the old fashioned way, never expecting short cuts and always putting his work and others first."
"For over 11 years, Mario and I have worked together and created some incredible glam moments. I’m so excited to finally announce our 2nd collaboration together. I’ve watched him work passionately for the past year on this collection and campaign."
Such a good read. Everyone should read this entire thread from a journalist who has followed this case for 18 years!

"This was the most special, nostalgic day of my life and we felt my dad’s presence enjoying this day with us!  I kept it together at lunch even though I cried during the planning process. But at the end I went into my old bathroom, closed the door &amp; cried so hard."
I even remade the exact license plates. (Yes my mom had a 2 DIE 4 license plate!) We drove to the home in these cars and relived our childhood! This was the best day ever. I am so proud I was able to keep such a meaningful surprise a secret from my mom and sisters for weeks!
I had some waiting outside so we could drive them to the house and the rest were lined up in the driveway of the house exactly how my parents used to have them parked.
"We had lunch at the home as if it hadn’t changed and we cried the entire time. When we walked out to get our cars to drive there, I had another surprise! I had rented every car my parents ever owned."
"All of our memories live here especially with our dad. It’s where each Kardashian child was born &amp; made us who we are. Growing up, the home had the most ridiculous wallpaper &amp; kitchen set! I remade all of our table settings out of the same fabric &amp; print as the wallpaper."
I then gave everyone the REAL invitation and once everyone saw the address for where we would be going tears filled the room. I rented our childhood home.
"For her birthday I planned a small lunch, with just her kids and her closest friends of 40 + years. I sent out invites with a location where we all met. When everyone arrived, I told them I had a surprise and this wasn’t where we would be eating."
"Today we celebrate my mom. Anyone that knows her, knows how sentimental she is."
"Join me, @KourtneyKardash and @KhloeKardashian as we sit down with our friends @TheRealDaytime today and talk about our new @KKWFragrance! Check your local listings!"
You’ve given us the tools to be the best we can be and have taught us that kindness rules the world!  I can’t wait to celebrate you today! I love you so much! Happy Birthday @KrisJenner
"Today is your day! You are the best mom in the entire world. I don’t know how you do it! Seriously my love and respect for you grows every single day seeing how you  manage to take care of 6 kids, a million grand kids and make everyone feel so loved and special."

"My body foundation really evens out and corrects your skin tone and conceals veins and bruises. My formula is super creamy, hydrating &amp; long lasting! I can’t wait for you guys to try the entire Body Collection launching on Friday at 12pm pst at   #kkwbeauty"
If you let it dry before putting your clothes on it transfers way less &amp; if you set it with a translucent powder it hardly transfers at all. It was important to keep the skin looking flawless yet natural. We didn’t have translucent powder but tried pressed powder which worked too
Let’s talk about the transfer. I’ve been using body makeup for over a decade &amp; in my experience you either get coverage that doesn’t transfer but it’s super dry and looks fake or it’s the opposite and really moisturizing but completely transfers. My new body makeup is in between.
My grandma MJ asked me about my @kkwbeauty Body Makeup and wanted me to come over to help cover her veins. North &amp; I went straight to her house &amp; showed her exactly how to use it &amp; I love how happy she is with the results! How amazing is this before and after on MJ?!

"Year 7- 2019 Manfred Thierry Mugler For the house of Mugler. Mr. Mugler  hasn’t designed in 20 years &amp; made me the most magical dripping wet dress &amp; printed latex dress w crystals! I have to pinch myself, I am attending the Met Gala while on the cover of Vogue!!! God is good! 🙏🏼"
Camp Crystal Girl!!! 💎💎💎 Moiré printed latex with the crystal drip 💧Another new creation 🛸@ManfredTMugler  Manfred Thierry Mugler for Kim Kardashian West / MET BALL 2019 with Mugler Fashion House. Revisited archive pieces for Mugler Fashion House @Mugler
Mugler Drip💧  Straight out of the ocean  @ManfredTMugler . His first design in 20 years  Manfred Thierry Mugler for Kim Kardashian West / MET BALL 2019 with Mugler Fashion House. @Mugler
This Camp theme deserves two looks 😉
Mood 💦💦💦
"Year 6- 2018 Versace. This was the first time Donatella recreated one of Gianni’s cross dresses that were in the exhibit. This dress fit like a glove! I knew exactly what I wanted and was my most confident this year! 90’s, chainmail, simple and sexy."
Year 5-2017 Vivienne Westwood.  This was my first year going solo. I was so nervous to go by myself I almost threw up on the way &amp; I had to pee every second.. I was FaceTiming my sisters to meet up at the top of the stairs. Vivienne made me this beautiful dress from her archive.
Year 4- 2016 Olivier Rousteing for Balmain. I was back to insecure this year because I hadn’t lost all of my baby weight. Big mistake to bleach the brows but Kanye looked so good this year with those blue eyes! It was super controversial that he wore denim.
Year 3-2015 Peter Dundas for Roberto Cavalli. This is his first dress designing for Cavalli. I was 2 months Pregnant with Saint &amp; desperately trying to hide it. I felt so confident this year! I had more of an opinion and collaborated so well. I really felt so good this night.
"Year 2- 2014 Alber Elbaz for Lanvin. I was invited on my own this year! We just had our Vogue cover &amp; Alber gave me the dress I wore on the cover so Anna suggested I wear Lanvin. Not sure why we picked blue lol. Following our cover, this is a dream."
Year 1- 2013 Riccardo Tisci for Givenchy. I was Kanye’s plus one &amp; so nervous! I didn’t know anyone &amp;  I’m sure no one wanted me there lol.  I did my own lipstick &amp; the color is so off. I went home &amp; cried after of insecurity but this is one of my fave looks now.
"Wait just saw news our baby boy came but that’s not true! It’s Met Monday, I’m in NYC. I would be at the hospital lol"

Special thank you to my husband Kanye for speaking into existence that one day I would grace the cover of Vogue when everyone told me to be “more realistic.” #dreamsdocometrue #speakitintoexistence #voguemagazine
"I remember as a little girl flipping through my mom’s subscription each month and dreaming of one day gracing the cover of this iconic magazine. Thank you to the incredible Anna Wintour for your support as always, it means the world to me."
"I’ve dreamed of this moment for so long, many said it would never come. Words cannot begin to express how much of an honor it is to have my first solo US cover of @VogueMagazine."

And we should not be okay with the risk that an innocent person could be executed. I hope we can turn toward better solutions that focus more on healing victims of trauma and prioritizing fairness and justice.
I have met with and am very supportive of Governor Newsom and his decision to help bring an end to the California Death Penalty. Racial bias and unfairness run deep throughout the justice system but especially when it comes to the death penalty.
"For the last year, I have immersed myself in learning about the criminal justice system. I visited prisons, met with formerly incarcerated people, and helped with cases of individual injustice - including two death penalty cases."

"So, as always, don’t believe everything you read and see online. I don’t have any relationships with these sites. I’m not leaking my looks to anyone, and I don’t support what these companies are doing."
"I often plan for weeks, sometimes months, and even a year in advance, and I’m grateful for every fashion moment those designers and their dresses have helped me create."
My relationships with designers are very important to me. It's taken me over a decade to build them and I have a huge amount of respect for the amount of work that they put into bringing their ideas to life.
This is a way to get people to sign up for their mailing list and make people believe there is some kind of relationship between me and this fashion site. There is not.
"Only two days ago, I was privileged enough to wear a one-of-a-kind vintage Mugler dress and in less than 24 hours it was knocked off and thrown up on a site - but it's not for sale. You have to sign up for a waitlist because the dress hasn’t even been made to sell yet."
"I’ve watched these companies profit off my husband’s work for years and now that it’s also affecting designers who have been so generous to give me access to their beautiful works, I can no longer sit silent."
"It’s devastating to see these fashion companies rip off designs that have taken the blood, sweat and tears of true designers who have put their all into their own original ideas."
We lost a true legend! You were such an inspiration to the world! You shot my first fashion shoot &amp; I was so nervous to work w such an icon! The world is so much chicer because u existed! I’m beyond honored to have had the opportunity to work w u. U are so loved &amp; will be missed

I have and will always applaud any efforts to give back to the community. To fight for justice and to help uplift the youth. But I will never tolerate someone who was close to Kanye who attempts to use his late mother’s name to publicly shame him while pretending to do good.
"Kanye gave his “friend” an opportunity to run an organization on his own. So now that Kanye is being publicly shamed for not being involved makes no sense and,  at this exact time, just seems very calculated."
"After several years of lack of performance from the organization and Kanye going through personal financial issues, he could no longer fund salaries. Rhymefest asked to take it over and Kanye agreed with no financial strings attached."
"Kanye and Donda started  a charity called Loop Dreams. When Donda passed, they changed the name to Donda’s House. Kanye paid Rhymefest a salary to run it."

I saw you at our studio a few weeks ago so why didn’t you bring this up then @RHYMEFEST ? You were trying to get Kanye to listen to your sub par beats.  You have the audacity to use Kanye’s mom name to try to shead a negative light on Kanye.
U haven’t been right since u got kicked out of the studio in Hawaii wearing fake Yeezy’s @RHYMEFEST 😂 You’re over levergenging Kanye’s name &amp; asked Kanye to donate money to u so stop w your fake community politics &amp; lies. Truth is you haven’t been able to sustain the foundation

The skincare products in my bathroom cabinet
Mental Health is no joke and the media needs to stop spitting that out so casually. Bottom line
Kanye will never run in the race of popular opinion and we know that and that’s why I love him and respect him and in a few years when someone else says the same exact thing but they aren’t labeled the way he is  and you will all praise them! Kanye is years ahead of his time
"Now when he spoke out about Trump... Most people (including myself) have very different feelings &amp; opinions about this. But this is HIS opinion.  I believe in people being able to have their own opinions,even if really different from mine He never said he agrees with his politics"
"He’s a free thinker, is that not allowed in America? Because some of his ideas differ from yours you have to throw in the mental health card? That’s just not fair. He’s actually out of the sunken place when he’s being himself which is very expressive"
Yesterday it was announced that Kanye had parted ways with some business people and media outlets made this about Kanye’s mental health. Rather than just a simple business decision. So I’m glad he tweeted about the state of his company and all of the exciting things happening
To the media trying to demonize my husband let me just say this... your commentary on Kanye being erratic &amp; his tweets being disturbing is actually scary. So quick to label him as having mental health issues for just being himself when he has always been expressive is not fair
"Come share your best screenshots on my favorite shopping app, Screenshop! We are going to be giving 100 of my followers who download the app and share their favorite screenshots up to $1000! Make sure to follow @Screenshopit to see the winners! #screenshopambassador"

"Honestly, I’m so thankful to everyone who is giving me feedback on my beauty products &amp; I love hearing what everyone loves, and doesn’t love"
I love that she has an opinion and I’ll take what she said and use it to better my products.
I hung out with @jackieaina in my home and she was super sweet!!
"I figured I would just try again later, but then I realized you can’t add tags after the album is posted!"
When I uploaded the album I was tagging everyone that came to the party and for some reason it wouldn’t let me tag Jackie’s name.
I would never post someone’s pic on my page and then intentionally not tag them.
I just saw a story saying I intentionally didn’t tag @jackieaina in a pic I posted on Instagram because of a review she did about my line.

Did something have to happen?This is the only time in his life he can remain somewhat anon &amp;we're enjoying that
I will check it out
You should google Kerry Max Cook his story is fascinating and heart breaking #RightThisWrong
This will now prevent him from receiving the compensation he deserves for the decades he spent on death row.
These are the types of media stories I  Google when I can't sleep
"Wait prosecutors agreed to drop the murder charges, but they will continue to oppose Cook’s claims of actual innocence. Always a hang up!"
His chargers were just dropped after DNA evidence was finally brought in and cleared him. Can u imagine being wrongly imprisoned for 40 yrs
Just read the story of Kerry Max Cook. He had been on death row for a murder he didn't commit for almost 40 years.
Obsessed with my @Lumeecase Go to   to get one!

If u only saw Northie's reaction! As a mom I got protective and left that scary moment out of the episode for her privacy
But as a mother this as the scariest things that could have happened w your child in the car. Khloe handled it so well!
The crash was so scary &amp; the way it was edited doesn't even do it justice! I keep North out of the show so we had to cut around that footage
I don't even know why I started crying after! Just so happy everyone is ok! Scariest experience of my life!
I honestly couldn't believe we had car cams on when that happened!!!!! How scary was that seriously!!!!!!!!! I always wear my seat belt now!
Seriously I'm so lucky to have a friend like @psychicmediumje he gives the best advice and the truth!!! No matter what! Had to call him up!

wish me luck on the dieting...its soooo hard for me!
ok no more tweeting and procrastinating! LOL Glad some of u moms can relate. I'm reading the comments! For real....of to the gym!
i think after having a baby u get so excited u lost a lot of weight then u get comfortable &amp; eat how you used &amp; it creeps back up.
Just need to get down to my weight a few years ago. Not gonna complain anymore. Starting diet TODAY! No carbs. crazy workouts. Whos with me?
do any of u moms see their bodies just not the same? a different shape? ughhhh my hips &amp; butt are huge now! they were big to begin with!
I'm not gonna call it baby weight bc thats an excuse. i just gained weight &amp; that's it. why is it so much harder to lose after baby though!!
off to an intense workout. Can't seem to shake this last 15-20 lbs of baby weight. no more excuses. my baby is 1 years old! UGH
