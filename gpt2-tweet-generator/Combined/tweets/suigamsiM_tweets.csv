"I'm listening to 009 Sound System - Dreamscape in August 22nd, 2020"
calculated
"w/ the first part I mean that people are usually ""improving"" by playing newer maps, so sometimes older maps don't really have much competition on them so it's hard to see how much people have improved using the same metric, hence why people think all oldmap scores are impressive"
"honestly as much as its hard for me to see the improvement in top player skill sometimes, it's fucking insane that we've come to the point where people are HDDTing what were HDHR farm maps just a few years ago (looking at ryuk epiphany hddt)"
ok so actual reasons that arent off the top of my head  - updating maps - server not being able to handle all leaderboards/replays
"for 2: just dont make unranked #1 scores count lol  for 3: this requires a mindset change from staff and the community in general, i think that at least adding a leaderboard wouldn't hurt anyone, even for meme slider maps that people will get a 1% score on"
"as for 1: the fact that ranked would still give pp (and the fact that most mappers don't even care about leaderboards and just about the prestige from other mappers) wouldn't change things much. maybe promoting ranked maps more as ""official"" content, focusing on FAs would be cool"
"some i can think off the top of my head:  - takes the prestige off the ranked section - people would be able to farm #1 scores easily - would mean that unranked maps would technically become ""official content"", which includes some maps that staff might not want to see get popular"
"is there any argument still against having (no pp) leaderboards on all maps? with plays submitting on unranked maps and playcount working normally, i don't see why not just do it other than the fact it might render project loved useless"

what do you mean yousei teikoku isnt the name of the girl singing
"ill say the obvious thing:  if you take a certain map and submit it using another mapper's name, the reaction will be completely different than it would be if you used the original mapper's name in like 90% of cases"
"lots of people missing the point so let me explain better.  i'm not talking about ""people like 1-2 maps and dont like my maps wah wah"". im talking about mostly the mapper community having biased opinions towards certain mappers because of their previous opinions towards them"
"Just saying this because I spent years trying to please people who seem just completely impossible to please, no matter how much I improve or grow they will always find another excuse to say I'm bad or even say that ""I was better before I started changing"""
"After spending like 6 years trying to ""modernize"" myself I reached the conclusion that there is 0 point in doing it because the people who think I'm shit will always think I'm shit because that's what they want to think and not because my maps are actually bad in their mind"
"Hot take: At this point people (mostly mappers) dont even care about other mappers' map quality anymore, they only care about who is the mapper and then create a narrative on their head that fits what they think of they mapper so they have a biased opinion on the map"

this is all serious btw im actually taking commissions (contact me!!!) but i want to make it clear that i will NOT attempt to rank anything commissioned cuz that's just silly in my book  my goal is to bring more different stuff into osu so if you'd like that im all up for it
"Sorry this should've been on the priv account but i'm just so fucking pissed at this, like seriously why did i have to get the bad RNG on spawn  also i'd rather give something back to the community than just live off by donations like i've been doing lol"

i was learning masking on after effects with the www dance and thought i'd put it to use
dude actually did his on a sightread run lol
I missed a sliderend so its not a true FC
"This Place Will Grow is an album i've always loved, but as it was released right before Because Maybe none of the tracks made it into the album (also there is a slight style discrepancy, so i dont blame ren).  mapping pt3 was really fun and i hope to achieve the same with this :)"
that second sentence has not aged well  i may be making a mistake but there might be more to come
"again, this might NOT and, in fact, will NOT work for everyone. it has worked for me in a way that nothing did before, so i'm sharing this with other people. hopefully it will work for you, if you're getting tired of the game!  as a second option, mapping can be fun too!"
"and if you need help with sorting collections by year, @NitroChaos has an amazing collection database that sorts old maps (up to 2016) by year, so if you're into these maps, this will help A LOT on doing many of these steps."
"hopefully, by doing this, you'll find more interest in the game like i did after 12 years. i even made a farm collection by doing this same method and even farming has become more enjoyable to me than it used to be. if you're getting too frustrated, take a rest and try tomorrow!"
"step 5: once you FC a map, remove it from the collection.  by doing this, you'll keep your collection fresh. if you want, you can add it to another collection ""scores to improve"" if you really like the map, but personally i try to move on to other maps as soon as i get one done."
"step 4: don't play your maps too much, and cycle through them. meanwhile, find more maps by repeating process 3 (and 2 if necessary).  what this does is avoid mindblocking and getting tired of a map, while making your map choice fresh and keeping you playing different stuff."
"step 3: actually pick your maps.  what this means is... play maps that fit your criteria. but play them ONCE. or twice, or a bit more, but don't overdo it. get a feel for the map, see if you can FC it. if you got it first try, nice! if not, add them to a collection ""FCable""."
"remember that tastes vary from person to person - you may find it more fun to play nomod anime jump 4 minute maps that train consistency, wub maps, or gimmick maps. it's different for everyone. so try to focus on what YOU enjoy playing, but there's more to that."
"step 2: find your comfortable star rating range. i can personally FC maps from up to 7.4 stars or so, but i certainly don't feel myself enjoying these maps. i found out that DT on ~4 stars maps from 2011-12, totalling around 5.7-6.5 star rating, was the most fun for me."
"step 1: download a lot of maps. A LOT of maps. there are some torrent websites around that let you download all maps by year. pick a year (or two, or three) that you're more comfortable with, and download all maps from that. eventually you'll osu! will look like this."
"hey, if anyone has been struggling to enjoy the game (as i have in the past), thought it'd be nice to share what i've been doing and has been working a lot lately (almost getting the highest playcount i've ever had in a month, just less than 20 days in, in 12 years)"
"just hope people see this as more than ""the idke map"" as this was a really cool project to work on, as much as i appreciate idke's plays and dedication on it, it's a bit silly how the plays became bigger than the project lmao"
"ranked!!!!!!  i guess this is it for because maybe, this was a fun project"
"this is qualified now btw :D  this map is definitely not for everyone, but i'm glad if you give it a try"
due to popular demand i added a nerfed diff (6.45*) where the map plays more like a regular one. you'll miss on the zigzag gimmicks but you get the playability back!

HELP???  I've seen that Cookiezi (chocomint) has been changing his Osu! language lately all the time. I've tried doing this and surprisingly I've been passing a few 6 star maps that I could not before. Are there any other hidden tips by the pro players? Do you know of any languag

Seriously fuck this.
on hawku drivers ive tried messing around with the MaxPressure option on the config but it doesn't seem to do anything useful for the situation.  i'm kinda running out of options. i'm starting to think it's my pen/tablet but then it wouldnt make any sense to not happen on 5.3-5.3
"this happens on every newer wacom tablet and hawku/devocub as well, which is why i've been using 5.3-5.3 (an ancient, ctl460 driver) as it is the ONLY driver where this doesn't happen.  it also tends to doubletap whenever i tapx.  if this keeps up i might be forced to quit tapx"
"ok, can anyone help with this? posting on twitter is my last resort i guess  check the keybindings. i'm holding down the pen on my tablet to make it clear, but it happens regardless. it just keeps randomly tapping even if i don't move the pen at all"

new vaporwave map!!!! i mapped this one on stream yesterday  iacon - 复兴 Ressurection    hope u enjoy : ] also 4.20* wasnt intentional
i miss mapper ranking
the solution to this problem (which if you didnt notice cuz of twitters quality destruction is the stack being 1 pixel off whenever you enter test mode) is stacking the previous sliderend to the next sliderhead and not the opposite  it's a simple solution but it's still annoying
dont you love it when that happens and then you have a 1px off stack
my mapping song choices in 2019: has to be a song with interesting rhythms that can be playable while not being repetitive to the player. i need to enjoy the song and it has to bring a good feeling for the player  my mapping song choices in 2010:

I know not that many people are interested in shit like that but I figured I'd make this public since it's a way for me to properly archive these maps. Hope you enjoy!  Links / map list (90 maps in total):
"Also, I'm putting all of my unsubmitted maps from over the years in another pack. That includes unfinished stuff and just maps that were never submitted to begin with (some famous ones like the Carpenter Brut jump training map are there)."
"Following my reupload spree, you may have noticed (probably not) that I didn't reupload all maps.  I left out of BSS maps that were deemed too unfinished/bad/meme-y to be submitted, so I grouped them all into a pack with all of them."
"Re-uploaded Hélio dos Passos - Fica Comigo Agora (3.66*). Originally mapped in December 2014     This will be my last reupload. As for the other ones that I didn't reupload, I'll post something about them shortly."
Re-uploaded NegaRen - Just Wanna Tell You (5.57*). Originally mapped in April 2013     I SWEAR ITS THE LAST TIME I REUPLOAD THIS MAP I KNOW I DID IT 4 TIMES ALREADY
Re-uploaded Renard - zerd_01 (6.02*). Originally mapped in October 2017     I swear I'm almost done with these. Sorry for keeping the map spam alive
while looking in my old mediafire folder with lost 2010 maps i found this and i have no idea why i made this
"Re-uploaded Andromeda - Tits that fits (5.26*). Originally mapped in like... 2014 or so, but I submitted it in November 2015     I still love this map so much even though it's so simple and silly"

just a quick reminder that you can favorite the map and submit it to the Loved form if you like the map enough and you want it to have a leaderboard     it doesn't take long to submit the map and it would really help gathering attention to it for Loved

"seriously there's just something special about gens' maps  while they have the structure of an old symmetric map, it just feels fascinating to look at the ideas he explores while keeping his style in every map  makes me miss when we had ""mapping styles"" for every different mapper"

yea i would love to go for ranked with this but i haven't been contributing to the mapping community in the past year and i guess i need to do that to get mods/BNs  if you're a BN and you're interested in checking this out tell me. for now i'll let it get graved

like most of my twitter feed is either brazilians arguing about some meme page copying content from another meme page or gringos talking about how artists are doing something to a pokemon character  i think its rly dumb &amp; then i remember i complain about Osu maps every 5 days
when you take vacations and then come back to the internet its like you become an alien that cant understand why everyone is fighting over the dumbest stuff for a while
I think that for a mapper to get their first ranked mapset they should have at least 1 ranked mapset already so the ranking section has more quality.
"btw for those wondering ""wow but ur maps are so popular and youre a well known mapper, how do u struggle?""  my maps are popular between players, not mappers. mappers have much different taste in maps than players and my mapping style doesnt offer what they enjoy in most cases"
"no wonder this game is filled with weeaboo crap, if u dont try to map these things and dont have a specific mapping style that pleases the majority of other mappers then theres 0.1% chance to actually get ur maps somewhere"
seriously im so fucking mad because i have to find a bn who: - doesnt hate me - likes my maps - likes the songs i map - is active  apparently these 4 things are mutually exclusive so its fucking impossible to get my maps ranked and i hate it
Im very pissed so i will make passive aggressive tweets until a drama happens and i black out thanks
You know mapping is fucked when you've got a 120BPM 3* map that gets ranked with AR9. With another 4* diff being AR9.6. And then the highest AR is 9.8 on the 4.5* diff. Good job BNs !

feelin really sick and coughing my lungs out so i did what any reasonable person would do  spent 4 hours in the editor with no breaks to finish mapping another song in because maybe  yea i may die soon but at least its almost 50% complete in 5 days
ranked!! go get your sweet free pp!!!
Dude that sliderbreak
pt 3.1 is already 30% done lol this is going pretty fast
looking back at it because maybe pt1 was really fucking overdone and thats why i just dont find the map fun at all  its not as fun when every single thing is a jump  ill try to make pt3.1 more like pt2 even if that makes it easier than pt1 at most parts
"Renard - Because Maybe! pt. 3.1 has just been submitted! i've been wanting to remap pt3 for a while, guess we're starting now let's see if I can finish this in less than 3 years"

in this house we respect gen 2
objective truth facts &amp; logic pokemon games tier list
or maybe it's just me because the maps from when i started playing osu! were mapped by cavemen
watching in editor the maps you used to love when you started the game after learning how to map is just like watching that movie from your childhood you swear it was good but when you see it again you just think to yourself how did you even like this
at this rate all because maybe parts will be fc'd before What You Do lmao
being born is genetics
thank you @oonadoesitworst
"i know this is hard to imagine and it'd be pretty shitty but considering how restrictive and ridiculously company-favored copyright laws are becoming, it might be a necessary step at some point in the future for the sake of osu!'s life, although i seriously hope it never happens"
of course the ideal thing would be to remove all of the copyright infringing maps but that's just not feasible for the sake of the community. but i can see a future where people might be limited to map featured artists' songs not becoming as bad as it once was
"i think featured artists (and mappers' guild) are the best thing that happened to osu! regarding its long-term health  for all the shit we've always got from VSRGs and other rhythm games regarding piracy, it's really nice to see osu! thriving and encouraging original content"

"with the current spinner discussion i've seen a lot of stuff like ""why are spinners even in the game, they're not rhythm game elements, peppy is drunk???"" being said  it's understandable but it just makes me sad that most of the community hasn't heard of elite beat agents/OTO"

i just needed 8 years to do this ez
13 thousand likes
because most people would be able to play this map much better if it was made with a higher AR. It feels like the AR was set to 9 just to make it look different or to get a reaction out of people and that annoys me. /u/vinxis why did you make it AR9?
"Ei pessoal, acabei de saber que meu amigo @a_kochav foi diagnosticado com uma raríssima doença terminal e que seu último desejo foi que o HP drain fosse removido do jogo. peppy, por favor, já que você não mandou os prêmios da OWC pra ele, pelo menos realize o desejo dele"

"I need help, please. =/"
"someone being a spinhacker is a big mystery for me  the only reason you'd cheat in osu would be for attention. but spinhacking is so obvious that once you do a score that is actually notable (aka not easy diff fullmod), you'll get pointed out and banned, so you stay under radar"
"My new map, one i've been working on for quite a while! Spent the past month working on the timing and overall in the map, so I hope it's good.  Jay Tholen - Millennium Anthem (2000 New Years Eve)  BWLLLLLLL"

"i'm not sure on how the policy has changed on haxsubmitting over ranked maps ever since cases like Solo Tu and Ass Up happened, but i'm sure the osu! administration team is still capable of doing it"
"dont care about the current bg/nsfw drama but if you're gonna force sfw stuff, PLEASE apply that retroactively.  we have at least 20 cases of ranked background with borderline explicit pics of underage anime girls (or, the example I always like to mention, rocket nipples)"

New GANGSTA map. Watch out for the extreme jump section!!
"the cool thing about mapping is how different maps can be from each other even in the same song. when u try to ""objectively"" judge a mapping style, ur limiting it to a sum of several factors and it has to follow them as closely as possible, even though they don't make a map good"
"if i decide to make an iNiStyle symmetrical map for a contest because i feel the song entirely supports it, it's going to score extremely low because this style abandons rhythm variety and complexity in favour of structure. does it make it a worse map though?.."
mapping is 99% a subjective thing (unless ur a beginner mapper who doesnt know what you are doing) so it feels weird whenever people try to make it objetive and contests are a big part of that

please tell me it works if even with the 2008 build. it doesn't render the map properly. BSS keeps converting the .osu file to a v14 beatmap file even though it's supposed to be v5. I'm worried that can cause problems even though it didn't for me

"from a purely mapper standpoint, this exists:"
you can also divide the question in 2. what do you mean by influential? influential towards mappers? influential in popularity with players? influential in meta changes through mapping? or maybe a sum of all of these?  it would be cool to hear some thoughts on this

14. had a bunch of unsubmitted maps in 2008 cuz i didnt know how to submit maps but they sucked submitted my first one in january 2009 and it got nuked in 15 minutes (still world record)  then i hung around in mapping channels ingame and after 9 months got my first ranked map
5. wave sliders and linear patterns  6. i dont care  7. lately graveyard because ranking maps is rly stressful and not worth the effort/changing stuff u intended to do  8. not big money  9. lol  10. still doll (DONT KILL MAPPERS' SPIRITS)  11. no  12. lol/10  13. any i havent met
"4. krisom, larto, gens, kirby, kuron-kun, skystar, rlc, pishifat, card n'force, handsome, galvenize, luanny, lesjuh, charles445, monstrata, grumd, ykcarrot, dsco, rustbell  all of these strongly influenced me/my mapping at some point"
1. i could talk about any old mapper here but i'll say kuron-kun for all his efforts in helping the mapping community 2. anyone who forces their own mapping views into other ppl 3. me telling some guy with a red vox avatar that i liked his ava and i mapped one of their songs
"so after 1 month i realized that although i still think many of the things in there, i believe that osu! itself isnt the source of my internal problems  but the ""being a public person"" thing still holds up for me so yeah itll still be kinda hard for me to be active in discussions"

i knew it wasn't going to be good enough and i went through with it anyway in hopes that people would hype the shit out of it just because it's big black lol.  that being said the original isn't good either and is just overhyped but what can you do about that

"tbh i don't really get the idea of creating hype for maps. the best thing about a map is the element of surprise, I want to expect nothing from a map and find out it's actually a great map instead of something marketed as the second coming of Jesus then you have just another map"

"people talk about getting to most played with pp maps but no one talks about making the least played map  get an experimental 7+ min song from an unknown artist, make an Easy diff only and rank it"

unironically remove disqus &amp; youtube comments from anything osu related im tired of losing my iq because of 5-6 digit people who think they know about mapping/top players/basically any subject

well that meme blew up wtf
actually pushed myself to finish it this night
just kidding I gotta go to uni and then I'll have a good night of sleep  but after that I won't rest until it's finished
okay be prepared because I got the idea for the absolutely perfect osu! meme and I will not rest until it is finished
"patterns were some kind of ""mapper trademark"". ztrot jumps, krisom kriss-krosses, Nharox etna sliders, and all other sorts of things that meant ""this guy basically invented this kind of thing in mapping and does it well"""
"Rolled's MAX FOREVER is dead forever, but the map essentially revolved around this whole thing. It had patterns from 10 different maps and showed respect to them by doing that and referencing them in the storyboard"
"usually this sort of thing happened only in gimmick maps, but nico medleys are the biggest example of this thing.     these contain patterns from several other maps which were ranked at the time, obviously referencing the songs"
something that I just realized is how straight up copying patterns from other people's maps was such a big deal in 2008-2009. but in a good way. it was like the biggest form of respect you could show to a map/mapper and how it meant the map was a big reference in the community
please dont take this seriously btw

"another one:  the whole ""oops I compiled the mp3 in the wrong order"" caused me to change what was ""part 1"" to part 3. Back in 2011, changing the mp3 name would often glitch the map even if you changed it in the .osu, so the ranked mapset of pt.3 looks like this:"

"and yes, i'm still pissed about hymn to the unobtainable. maybe it's 100% in the song choice but this is just proving it further that the effort on making your map as good as possible is almost inversely proportional to the amount of people who will enjoy it"
i'm just not doing that because i'd like to have a reputation of keeping the ranking section fresh with songs i like and mapping for the public that enjoys my maps.  but anyone can just spam meme songs with low-effort maps and you get much more praise for doing that
"this brings back the stuff I tweeted a while ago.  why even put effort into bringing variety to the ranking section with maps that you genuinely put effort on, on songs you like, when you get like 10k plays total on that map; while you can just map a meme song and get attention?"
"tl;dr: ""it was just a social experiment broooo0o0oooo"""
"I'm not planning on ever ranking a meme-map like this again, honestly it's not worth it to stain my reputation even further by making low-quality maps of low-quality songs. I'd rather just make average-quality maps of songs I love (but that the community doesn't really like)"
actually serious content btw.  from what i've gathered I got a bunch of 1-votes (fun fact! one of my serious maps from a few months ago is still rated lower than D se Dab because very few people played the map and barely anyone liked it) but it seems to be doing well
"in case you missed it, here are my thoughts on d se dab:    i posted it on the map description, so don't mind the twitter thumbnail system using the first line as a joke"

"of course usually it's about ""mapping for a niche public because you can't make everybody happy"" but  even for this niche public, there is a high chance that they will end up playing your map once then forgetting about it (if its not some 6*+ map). why even bother?"
"when i started mapping and throughout most of my mapping career, the biggest motivator for everyone was ""to see a map of x song/artist ranked"", but now with so many different maps and people being focused more on maps than songs, this is a silly concept  nowadays"
"your map only gets attention from the general public if it's:  a) farm map. b) extremely popular song (usually farm map as well) e.g. anime of the season, very famous pop song c) do something really uncommon in ranked maps/ concept mapping. e.g.: dsco/hw"
"since the community is so divided in what is ""quality mapping"" and what isn't, it's a bit hard for me to say. tech maps are already getting oversaturated, and anything that is a ""regular"" map will easily get forgotten after like ~3 days of ranking."
"stupid question, but is there any motivation in getting your map ranked nowadays aside from ""making a farm map so lots of people play it""?"

"On parts 1 and 3, if you open the map in editor and scroll to around 13:37, you'll find something nice!  Due to rhythm limitations on part 2, I couldn't exactly do it there, so I had to improvise a bit  I initially did it as a promise for an old osu! friend."
"there are a bunch of really interesting facts about the map, I should list them all when I'm bored"
"speaking of Because Maybe, throwback to 2011 when I was mapping ""part 1"" and someone posted this on forum. that was when I realized I compiled the mp3s in the wrong order and noticed that when I was 10 minutes into the map.  if you didn't know why it's pt. 3 - 2 - 1, now you know"
"oh yes remember that time when people called The Big Black ""senseless noise"""
"Next step is trying to get it ranked and gathering mods. If you can mod or are a BN, please give your input so this effort won't be in vain :(  Thank you everyone!"
"by that, I mean that there were many situations where the map stayed untouched for months, even years, and I could have done that a lot sooner.  But I'm still glad many people supported me and helped me through it all. I'm really satisfied with the end result of the project."
"I'm a bit sick and tired to write this but...  I have finally finished mapping the entire Because Maybe! album. I can say I'm happy for finally finishing this project that started 7 years ago, but I can't help but feel a bit upset that most of that time wasn't really spent well"

"but as we all know that doesn't solve anything and I'd be back in a few days anyway, so all I can do is come clean and ask for forgiveness (unless you don't care about circle clicking drama, honestly the better option)."
"there's really no excuse for acting the way I've been acting in the past few days, with the aggressiveness and all the drama. i can't really justify myself other than me being immature, so I felt like quitting the game was the better option, so I wouldn't cause trouble anymore."
"also my reaction to xasuma stealing my #1s was totally unwarranted. if i have a #1 that's so easily taken, then I didn't deserve it in the first place anyway."

"our*, ztrot mapped 50% of it  and what I mean by that is that when we mapped Airman in 2010, HolyCOW's version was pretty damn popular even though everyone thought it was a terrible map. I assume this is a somewhat similar situation"

how to fix pp system  1. remove pp system 2. delete all maps 3. uninstall the game 4. lets all play ping pong
"by ""glorified"" i mean the general reaction from the community, such as ""pp for fc??"" ""omg best pp play???"" ""lol touchscreen players should kill themselves??"" and this kind of shit, trying to pretend pp should be a perfect way to measure skill and it's the only thing that matters"
"is pp a problem? yes, absolutely. is it the cause of most of the community behavior? i'd say no. any ranking system would be either glorified because it kinda works or simply be abused to death because it doesnt work. ppv2 is in the middle of that, so it gets worst of both worlds"
"also just want to say that pp isn't the cause for this whole ""map difficulty &gt; quality"" thing to exist. people were all around shithard maps instead of good ones even before ppv1. map quality was NEVER considered by the community"
"he defends osu! only in the point that ""nah osu! isn't trash because it's osu!, it's bad because of [bunch of unrelated factors as to why a game would be bad]""  i appreciate the intentions but it only shows how much of a small brain the ""REAL rhythm game community"" has"
"so if you needed definite proof that bemani/sdvx elitist fucks have NO IDEA of what osu! is about, there you go  guy says ""mapping is really bad because mappers dont know how to represent the song in a complex way"" but doesn't know what a tech map is"
"in addition to the nightcore mod, osu! should have the Space Jam mod, where Come On And Slam is mashed up with the song being played"

"i should completely quit mapping, playing, &amp; being involved with community issues  &amp; 100% stick to shitposting because thats the only thing that doesnt make me want to kill myself while being involved with this game"
honestly i'm surprised that people didn't advocate for irre's restriction as well or banning him from submitting more maps ever again
the saddest part is that i can't even comment my opinion on this without getting attacked by angry mappers lol. irre did NOT deserve this lmao
i wonder if the osu! community will cry about irre the same as they cried about ailv... oh wait XD
"i'm not saying this in spite of monstrata because i was just like him (although he's much better at talking and convincing people he's right). sometimes it's the best way to have your revenge against the ""unfair staff who disliked you &amp; kicked you"""
"by the way i may be biased here because UC's map made me genuinely angry because of how technically bad it was, so don't take my opinion too seriously.  just remember that monstrata loves to create drama against people he doesn't like, so don't take him too seriously!"
"irre has his standards of mapping and he was clearly concerned about quality of a map that clearly lacked in technical quality reaching the ranked section. not the best approach, but a valid one.  people mass-reporting him and boycotting his maps (LOL???) are just silly."
"as someone who said literally the same thing irre said in #modhelp and shares his opinion:  bro if you're a qat might as well not say this kind of stuff, but lmao the community reaction. people acting like monstrata is a god who is punishing the EVIL QATs!!!!"

hey guys i'm actually trying to rank dse dab     need mods!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
btw do people actually think get jinxed is a bad map?  i know it's hated because pp but i honestly can't see what is wrong with the map besides the Master diff being a bit bland (although i believe tarrasky did it on purpose)

"also these ""x pp dinner"" images are not funny or interesting in any way  it lost any humor after like the 7th time people posted it"

"set finished! another vaporwave one, looking for mods now :D"
first world mapping problems
y-yes
when i finally get a ranked map
unfollowing me will not fix the fact that it has already happened
"help, i just installed osu! on this new pc but it's stuck on ""pending verification"" even though i already verified my account lol, tried restarting osu! &amp; googling it but nothing useful"
my MACINTOSH PLUS map is ranked! you should play it if you like vaporwave/chill songs!
"new pc finally arrived, RIP this brave warrior, 2011-2018   (trying to run rocket league at lowest settings on 800x600)"
"My biggest goal is to have it done this year. I believe I won't be able to rank it because getting my maps ranked is really hard with today's standards but I just want to finish it in 2018, maybe get it loved depending on score cap, idk. I don't really want to give up now"
"pt.2 is probably one of the best maps I've ever made, because it does that really well. I wanted to accomplish the same when mapping pt.1, but it's been harder and harder with time. I'm just glad people are fine with the wait and my slow-ass pace (30 seconds in 6 months lol)"
"Because Maybe is a different kind of map. Since pt.3 has a LOT of my 2010~11 style in it, I have to do it in a way that fits modern mapping while having consistency with 2011 styles. It doesn't seem that hard at first, but there's just so much effort into attempting to map it"
"""well just don't try to get them ranked"" isn't an excuse at this point, since maps will get 100% forgotten if they don't get ranked. ranking maps is the only way to get exposure. i personally wouldn't enjoy wasting my time on something no one will see"
"maybe you just have to git gud? that would make sense if circlejerking didn't happen. you can rank a shitmap of a mostly-disliked song if you have the connections. but for someone who doesn't really circlejerk, is there any point in mapping songs you enjoy?"
"feeling really stressed about mapping again, hope my thoughts make sense  what's the point of mapping (for rank) a song you enjoy when you're not gonna be able to get mods if people don't like the song? seems like a waste of time to try doing it when BNs ignore/deny you to death"
isn't that what Beatmap Nominators have been doing for the past few years?
i wonder if i'll be able to get a ranked map this year lol

2018 osu! goals: - be consistent enough to fc easy shit such as mynarco and epiphany nomod (yup haven't fc'd them yet) - learn a playstyle that isn't retarded (also lazer is gonna kill mine so not much choice) - get 3 maps ranked - be in brazil's owc2018 roster - 500pp score

"that being said it's just a stupid grudge i hold because of this song, i still believe renard is a good song producer but i just can't agree with how he treated his older works for some time. he kept saying something like ""mehhh i didn't put ~FEELING~ into these old tracks"""
"tfw you turn an amazing breakcore/raggacore song into some shitty ""happy hardcore"" jam or whatever the crap that is, while mentioning in the old description that ""it was always what he wanted to do with the original song"". i took that really seriously lol"
i can't believe that after 5 years i still get pissed off by listening to renard's banned forever remix. that was one of the biggest disappointments of my internet life and marked the exact point where i just stopped caring about renard songs
"but then again knowing how I am, after I say this I'm gonna end up submitting a 7* map next week because I felt like mapping it"
also please dont take the big black 2 tweet seriously i dont plan on mapping anything over 6* seriously ever again lol

im just really insecure and i guess posting my pics on the internet is probably not the best way to fix that since im basically asking for mockery

... im just gonna go to bed
yep i regret this completely

btw our participation in owc actually made me think about maybe joining other tournaments. too bad i can only join in niche oldmap/low-AR tournaments because that's all I can play reliably lol

"i don't really know what to say, i'm just heartbroken  i really wanted to say i played my best, but that'd just be plain lying. i was consistently FCing Terror, Talent Shredder and Switched-on Lotus and couldn't do well at either. it didn't make a difference in these maps..."
"it's over, gg"
i want to fucking die
i'm feeling so shitty. i may have doomed my own team because of something that was out of my control
"no seriously i'm fucking salty, this is unfair but there's nothing anyone can do about it, i tried investigating these lagspikes as much as possible, they happened on both panic holic and zetsubou... why?"
"but yeah let's just say i almost failed a map where I have 3 scorev2 FCs at the easiest part because ""i'm just bad"""
"thanks for the fucking lagspike that changed the outcome of the match :)  btw this is my cpu usage, of course its ""from my end"" XD"
10 minutes. may the gods of shakiness not betray me again
lol
according to the pp system i am now better than mafham because i did a 92% hddt haitai fc
i didnt put actual thought into this tweet please dont take it seriously  but ye if you think about it every pp map is 100% consistent with spacing and angles which is something that makes them easy to play?? that means consistency is bad and we should get back to 2009 :)
pp mapping was caused by the consistency fetish the mapping community has had since 2013

i never fucked around in a replay as much as this one lol
"that is, if you can FC the un-nerfed square section near the end"
"looking at the old version of my Atama diff, I'm fairly sure that even though the star rating is 7.1* instead of 6.9*, the map would have at least 20 FCs by now. Patterns are much simpler to play, and also it's AR10 instead of AR9"

the thumbnail + comment section on this video lol
the fact that le monstrata triangle memes still get upvoted in r/osugame means that I haven't spammed 727pp blue zenith enough

can someone please confirm that back in 2007 or 2008 if you got a D in a map there was an icon of a disappointed old man looking at you on the ranking screen??? or was that some skin that came with the updater? i don't know why i remember that but i do
DAE every brazilian is a drug dealer that kills people? XDDDDDDD 727PP  i'd rather have the samba + soccer stereotype than this kind of shit
I could never FC this map then I changed the mp3
the key i used to tap+x with finally died today after ~3 years... well now im kinda fucked because i can't find any other comfortable key to use lol
"for that, however, i'd need time and resources, which are two things i dont really have D: maybe  if i quit my job or something, but then i'd have to rely on actually having viewers &amp; donations. idk if it's worth the effort and resources"
"ive been told that i should stream more osu!, but for that i would need to buy a decent camera, a decent microphone and actually be good at the game (arguable, because they also told me people would watch because of the stupid playstyle)"
"oh yeah, i had one of those 1second lagspikes during mythologia which caused me to get a miss at 700x. i had only osu! and discord running and osu! at 240fps. i'm really frustrated and worried that this might change the outcome of a future match..."
i shouldn't watch the brazil vs poland VOD with chat but i'm gonna do it anyway because I feel the need to crush my self esteem even further
Next map!!! &gt;_&lt; :3

"2 misses because my tablet failed on the hitcircle-only part... still a good score i think? 2 sliderends dropped, probably the best acc on the map"
i dont think i can improve it more than this :s
I guess an S is pretty cool on this map
i want to die
"fc'd toumei elegy skystar, new top play!!!!!!!!! could've been ~480pp if i didn't acc choke near the end, but it's fine  got 8kpp as well, too bad it's on a 7* nomod farm map that every 3digit can do nowadays xd"

i wanted to stop playing but then i realized i bought a new tablet so i dont want to waste my money
i've gotten to the point of frustration where i start breaking my peripherals and hurt myself. time to stop playing for now.  don't take circle clicking games seriously. if you notice you've been playing for years and don't improve on anything then just fucking give up
stuck low 3digit after 9 years of playing btw :) gonna become worse than 6digit when lazer comes out because i abuse a stupid mechanic in the game btw :)
no seriously I'm legit sad everytime I think I do a good score I realize that it's either on an underplayed 2008 map or someone comes and instantly beats me

oh hey yeah
"btw yeah sickoh was a fucking asshat. sorry if anyone in canada felt offended by that, it was pretty unnecessary"

lets just say we have a bunch of interesting surprises that brazilian fans won't really enjoy too much
prepare for extreme amounts of brazilian salt in ~20 mins
"Ugh, what a miserable experience, my god."
"or something and the park’s almost closed, so you just resign yourself to your fate, and well, you go to sleep, and hope for a better day tomorrow. Cuz, and that, my friends, is exactly how playing this goddamn map feels like."
"And so your mother finally agrees to take you back home, and then you just kinda, when you’re back home you just crawl up into bed, and then you get even saltier because the rain finally stopped, but it’s too late to go back there now because it’s like, five p.m."
"let go of your jacket and it falls into the abyss. Like literally the abyss, it’s just a giant gaping hole, underneath the roller coaster because OSHA hadn’t been invented yet. So it’s like, yep, that’s officially, o-fficially, literally the worst day ever."
"Then, he’s like, “okay, but don’t say I didn’t warn you.” Then you go on the roller coaster, it feels fun at first, but that’s before you get, the rain is so fierce, just from the sheer speeds, that it feels like someone’s pissing in your face, and you start crying"
"kind of a makeshift rain preventer, and so you try and go on a, like some kind of ride with it, it’s like, the ride operator’s like, “are you sure you wanna do this? It’s raining?” You’re like, “yeah, I went to Six Flags, I need my money’s worth, c’mon!”"
"and, at least taking the popcorn, the popcorn machine has a fucking lid, it wouldn’t get all wet and soaked like the pretzels. But - so you decide, “maybe this isn’t so bad, let’s just, let’s just get a jacket.” So, you take your jacket and you put it over your head and that’s a"
"because the vendor inflated prices without telling anyone and I don’t know, I guess your mom just assumed that’s normal prices for a pretzel. It’s kinda, it’s kinda too bad really but, cuz you probably could’ve spent that fifteen dollars on popcorn or something"
"Then your mom complains at you because she spent all this money on tickets, it was like fifteen dollars, she got a sale and it still wasn’t worth the fifteen dollars just to go cuz he bought that dumb pretzel, and the pretzel was like, fifteen dollars on its own"
"So it’s really, it’s not actually the good part of the day. And, you get maybe halfway through your pretzel trying to savor what’s left of its like breaded salty goodness. And eventually you just give up and you’re like, “okay there’s no salvaging this day, let’s go home.”"
"outdoor vendor and he’s like, he didn’t actually afford a roof, he’s trying to make ends meet for his wife and kids so, he didn’t actually invest in a roof for his stall. And so all his pretzels are just soggy and who wants to eat a soggy pretzel?"
"dragged on to the next attraction and - the one bright thing in your day in this is that you do get one of those delicious soft pretzel things, like those are amazing. So you try and enjoy that in the rain, cuz it like, the rain makes it all soggy is the problem, there’s an"
"spinner toy, and it’s like, ugh, if your mom wasn’t there you’d just punch him right in the gullet. Just, give him a good stomping until all his guts fly out his spleen, which is now outside his body from the stomping but no -  before you can get too violent, you just kinda get"
"if they’re battery powered and they do the auto spin thing. But no, the last one just got sold to fucking Bobby from down the street, like, he lives next to you and he went to Six Flags too, despite that it was raining and, looks like it was just there to take your fucking"
"so most of it’s like gift shops and shit. The worst part is they’re all out of those cool little spinning toys, not fidget spinners but like the ones before that, like you just like, twirl them around with your finger. They’re like, the best thing for a six year old, especially"
"the rain. But, the rain keeps raining, because, it’s just one of those days, so, dejected you just kinda go to Six Flags anyway, you’re like, “okay maybe there’s some indoor attractions here, you know, attractions with roofs.” So, you try to go to some attractions with roofs,"
"to a gas stop and gets a bar of soap just to wash out your mouth with cuz you’re like six years old or something you shouldn’t be using those words. So like, she’s not gonna take you home or anything. So you just sit in the car for another half hour, and you try and wait out"
"and - by the time you actually do get there, it’s like, it’s not quite a downpour, but it’s more than a drizzle. It’s like, how the fuck are you supposed to go fucking fuck your Six fucking Flags in the rain, and then your mother like parks over at the side of the road and goes"
"so you’re like, “uhhh can we go to Six Flags anyway? Even though maybe it’ll stop raining?” and, you get your hopes up and, I mean you convince your mom to take you because she’s had too much vodka to think it’s a bad idea. So, way there, it just rains heavier and heavier and hea"
"Is this literally a baby's first edited map? These aren’t even on beat! Least you made an effort?! Did you make an effort? I hope so. This is sad. This is just, depressing, this is like - you wake up, your mother promised you’re going to Six Flags, but it’s like, it’s a rainy day"

event = osu! meetup in this case
"the whole point of the yaca 2018 tweet was to make a joke btw, we don't even know if the event is going to happen again lol"
ok now my location actually works so the people from my city can now see tweets about clicking circles whenever they look for soccer tweets

for my 4999th tweet Twitter decided to finally actually have the localization thing work for me and i'm no longer in Rio de Janeiro
"after listening to like 8 different musical genres at work, I realized that good videogame OSTs are the most inspiring thing"
"i wish halloween was actually relevant in brazil, but instead there are many people who think we should fight against ""american culture"" xd"

i know the start is the hardest part but xd nice reverse choke
im back home!! now i can finally purchase cuphead &amp; a hat in time

eu devia twittar mais em português
"going on a family trip tomorrow &amp; hopefully meeting an osu! friend there, hope things go well. time to go to bed! (last personal tweet)"
i'll see what i'm gonna do. maybe i'll get back to putting secret messages on my userpage. i knew some people really liked that :]
anyways that'd mean i would stop ranting &amp; talking about personal life here. don't wanna expose myself too much lately lol
then i instantly realize i'd end up abandoning one of the accounts after 2 days because im fucking lazy lolllllll
i should probably make a twitter account to use for personal stuff &amp; keep this one for osu! shitposting &amp; bad memes or something
my boss likes to watch pewdiepie during lunch
this is really fucking good :ok_hand:
life protip: dont give up on LDRs if you cant find anyone irl

thanks @wwonori
why is everyone complaining about despacito lol i'd much rather hear despacito than namirin/reol/nanahira moaning song #47
listening to '00s pop music is the completely perfect mix of cringe and nostalgia
woke up from a dream where I met this guy i haven't seen since 5th grade and he was asking me for opinions on his rick &amp; morty fanart
this should go into the disqus account but OHOHOHOH am I looking at a threat
aaaand my headphones died. there goes my mood for the rest of the week :|
"apparently someone posted my picture on reddit with the title ""lewd mismagius"". I am now reconsidering about posting pics in the future"
i know it's for a better system but now i'm kinda sad that loved by SP is gone because it was the only chance to get Why Am I So Angry loved
wondering if this jacket makes me look like im from the 60s [face reveal] [never seen before] [you won't believe it]
wow im actually starting to get non-osu! followers i guess ill stop tweeting about this game and start tweeting about politics
"new loved maps are out btw, run to reddit for your free karma"
mismagius actually starts sleeping earlier instead of complaining about waking up tired. you won't believe what happens next
2015 was a magical time for Brazil in osu!
i love it when i arrive in #modhelp and

"turns out that the old version of pensamento típico is so old that it's not even finished. wwc finished tho, 6.92*!"

Not sure about the top 100 but I can 100% confirm that there are a bunch of cheaters in the top 1000000. Hire me for osu! anticheat plz
i'll try to add them to the maps' descriptions when i get home
found the first versions of pensamento (6.00*) and worldwide choppers (6.92*) on my old dropbox account. cool
why does spare keep sniping me :/
found this pic again. this was such an amazing gift from the community &amp; i'll never forget how people have helped me when I needed it &lt;3
i realized following people from my city on twitter doesnt work when you have a pokemon avatar/info &amp; only tweet about a weeb circle game
"not going emo btw, when I have time I'll get back to mapping easier stuff, but as for now I'm afraid because maybe pt1 won't be back soon"
"before assumptions happen, it's mostly because there's nothing that gives me motivation to do it &amp; no real reward on trying to do it anyway"
I haven't felt like mapping anything 5+star in the past year. The past few days confirmed it's just not worth to even try lol

"I don't see moskau in the new loved pool, I think it's glitched or something, dev team should fix this ASAP"
"FC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  (inb4 heart attack comments. it's not the last diff, but it only had 1 fc as of yet!)"

using twitter at work while you're following top osu! players is basically suicide. every 5 tweets some swimsuit anime girl appears
looking at tweets from my city and everyone is either tweeting about football or sex (or going to a random party) lol
this is me
I wonder how sad your life has to be to spend your time hacking an osu! content youtube channel and uploading porn into it
"video of a guy playing a 5* map ends up in those ""Is this guy human?"" FB pages. these are the best comments i found"
:)
I want to sexchange in the future when I'll be able to have babies so I can have -GN's babies

only cool kids have this map
"wake up 5am, go to work, have lunch, get back to work, go to uni, get home at 11pm. no time for osu! on weekdays :("
haven't had time for anything lately. hope i dont become too inactive! work has been really taking my time but it's been really nice so far
what is the best pre-2010 best osu! play of all time and why is it shaggon's emerald sword FC?
"this episode literally got 3 questions which were the exact same, ignored the rest, asked chat for more questions, then ignored them all"
this coffee hour thing is pretty cool but you SERIOUSLY have to work on how you choose questions &amp; interact with twitch chat
finished the map in exactly 1 hour!

ignore my previous tweet. just did a 1140x run on big black and failed at the end
big black fc incoming

about HW's new map (   )
"hope lazer takes care of the current rating system, it's only used to vote maps 1 in case someone doesn't like the song/mapper"
"my recently ranked map is currently the 111th lowest rated map of all time, rated worse than ~85% of 2007 maps!"
i f2'd a map and played it twice and got #1 on it lol... sorry @cristovo017

"lmao someone literally commented ""any 5k player can do this score"" unironically on toy's What You Waiting For play"
"It's kinda weird to think that all those ""impossible"" HDHRDT WWW scores in old maps are now something that Toy can do in a few tries"
We're living in an osu! era where all those godly 2010-2013 scores are being dethroned. Not too sure how to feel about this
looking at the editor i realize more and more that something like worldwide choppers would've NEVER gotten ranked nowadays
when the disqus comment section in your map is christian so no swearing
i know the subject today is on flashlight accusations and choco-cookies but my map just got qualified!
sorry for being skeptical about someone who literally EZDTFL FC'd made of fire. I guess that's not something too hard nowadays lol
"I thought I made it clear that I wasn't ACCUSING him, I just said it was hard to believe. wtf is wrong with y'all lmao"
So I post an opinion on another player and when I wake up there's a reddit thread with comments shittalking me. Not posting this again
think*   like honestly it's a matter of time until he does something like EZDTFL freedom dive &amp; everyone thinks it's ok lol
"i honestly feel bad for this but i'm just really skeptical of ekoro's latest scores, no liveplay will make me thing EZFL'ing SS+ is doable"

PP maps in the Qualified section? Do you really think we would let that pass?
"(besides memes of course, but these happened in the beatmap threads with no problem)"
please give me a good argument as of why disqus beatmap comments are in any way useful or good for the osu! community
I'm ok with this
so my post on the thread got deleted &amp; it got locked... well thanks morgan lol

i fucking love this guy

yes i'm aware of the new airman song... there are a few reasons why a remap wouldn't really work though
"like seriously posting his stuff + titled ""FAMOUS OSU! STREAMER JERKING OFF"" with the ""small penis"" tag is probably overdoing it"

i hope i don't regret this too much but i have a lot of reasons to do it
i'm just gonna brace myself for the shitstorm
sad reactions only
got a nice play today
"more ezdt stuff, no mic because i dont have any decent one"
streaming some EZNC plays i guess
why has nobody dt'd this yet lol
2 less 100s and i would've gotten the S :/
why did filsdelama take my #1 :(
YOOOOO IM FINALLY DONE WITH DRACULA  because maybe pt1 31% finished
i finally did it. i accidentally went to uni wearing my pajamas gj i'm so proud of myself
yes i totally dont feel like killing myself after this night where i fell in love with a girl from my dreams and now i just wanna stay w her
the only reason why i'd want scorev2 to exist is because peppy doesn't want osu! scoring to move to 64bit int. so that's something i guess
now there's a big problem. 26% done and the max combo is already 2.2k w/ 84 million max score. you know what's gonna happen ~_~
ok because maybe pt1 is now officially 25% done
at this rate i might be finishing because maybe by late 2025
sorry renard but what did you smoke to fucking put dracula on because maybe this song is TERRIBLE ADSFGSADHJSDAESDH HOW DO I MAP THIS
"apparently someone tried to fix the map in 2014 and it worked for some time, but now something terrible happened &amp; easy diff is unranked"
WHAT THE FUCK I CANT SUBMIT A SCORE ON IT
"seriously this map   is BEYOND broken lmao easy diff has no scoreboard and normal diff is ""not submitted"" ingame"
in case you guys dont know this map/sb its time to appreciate it
"officially done with this, was really fun to get back to it and play whenever i didnt have phone connection"
"by the way i still have no idea why peppy unranked/deleted shanana, it was disco prince+wipeout's friend as the 3 single digit /s/ maps"
i think of 2007-08 corrupted maps as abandoned haunted houses that few brave people tried to enter
focusing on angles is a bit tiring but i guess it's better than mapping like 2011
breaking news: blue dragon submits new renard map but it looks like monstrata got drunk and tried to map  enjoy
just fuck my shit up fam
"current luck: sign up for old map tournament, get matched against @minusGN in the first round"
"""i think i'm finally grasping the concept of mapping correctly with good structure angles and everything is balanced properly and  oh"""
mapping is hard
someone once wanted to tell my parents that i was a pedo b/c i had just turned from 17 to 18 and the girl I was talking to was 15. so yeah
quick advice: after you turn 18 you should instantly have 400% more caution about online relationships
"btw there are more pedophiles in the osu! staff/alumni than in the deep web, idk what's so surprising about this xd"
everytime i miss some drama i instantly go to bahamete's twitter to know exactly what happened
"""Watch this again""  thanks youtube"
detailed explanation of how i feel trying to use modding queues
so do you guys have any cool vaporwave song to make a map of (no macplus 420 thing please)
me_irl
Saw a picture of Can't Defeat Airman background with a fidget spinner instead of a fan online. Please do not do that
the new pishifat video is just way too real to me.. too bad that his way of getting out of stagnation just doesn't work for me
how to completely drive everyone insane: make this twitter family thing mention EVERYONE in the picture
ok this eznc square sightreading thing is going a bit too far
current mood: i want to map absolutely everything  except because maybe pt1 which is what i should be mapping now
"Using 1/8 snap interval is NOT RECOMMENDED unless you are a very experienced beatmapper. If you find yourself using this, please consult som"
"hi i made a simple blank banshee map for fun, enjoy"
"fwiw i dont think the recent loved maps are bad, i just think many of them could've been ranked instead but the mappers simply dont want to"
all people want to be hyped for is the next episode of their tv shows but all i'm hyped for is the new pishifat video tomorrow 😩😩😩
true survivor is loved!! we did it :DDD
now i finally have more than 1mbps upload speed i can become the next circle people member
lol
for the first time im extremely pissed with the scoring system
why
its been 6 months since my last pic and i guess i look a bit different now so yeah hello
"sniped an #1 from polaco in an attempt to get him back to osu! but all he said was ""son of a bitch"" :("
nvm i just SSH'd it lol
idk if i already tweeted this but   how is this 5.08* with 255bpm bursts and squares lmao
i suddenly regain all my will to listen and appreciate renard's songs
"brb making a ""happy birthday konami, you're the responsible for many songs we mapped in osu! to exist!!!"" reddit thread"
renard publicly stated he doesn't like osu why are you making an osugame reddit thread appreciating him
"Blue Dragon Is One of the god mappers of Osu!, he made the most famous maps like Scarlett Rose and Airman, he's also a meme for mapping Seir"
seeing people hate other people just because they're from a specific country makes me sad :(
"in the end it deleted like 2k maps and osu! said ""fuck it i give up"" and simply didn't do anything"
this was a terrible idea
how to clean up your HDD
the only reason i wanna be as good as monstrata is to get threads on reddit when its my birthday
Just my opinion but they should unrank all old maps. New maps are much better and maps before 2013 are all squares and low AR (9 or less)
im really unhappy with this map but there u go xd   idk if im even gonna be able to finish it
mapping is stressful and doesnt give me any satisfaction because i'm too frustrated to make my map better
my favourite music genres are sped up vaporwave and slowed down nightcore
i like how openrec has a 270p 60fps option for their player because i've always wanted to watch low quality but smoothly
wuuuuuOOOOOOOOEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAA YEEAeaEAEeahaEaHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  i love pitch fucker
cough cough
i just realized pishifat could make a cool bill wurtz-styled video about the history of osu!
really cool :D
3dsmax is so buggy ;_; i just wanna model something but it just keeps fucking up
please dont remove notelocking in osunext :( i dont want my playstyle to be killed
i guess i'm gonna have to stop a bit to avoid rsi
"maybe getting 2k playcount in a week wasn't the best idea, terrible wrist/hand pain in the past 12 hours :("
i'm finally a 3digit again :D
ok
but these last few scores i've been setting proved that i can still play well. so good to know that :D
when youve playing the same game for 9 years and there are people who play for less than 1 year and are better than you it gets demotivating
"i've been able to set pretty much almost any score i always wanted to, it's been so fucking good"
"you guys have no idea of how happy i am, i feel like i improved more in the past week than in the past 2 years"
YOOOOOOOOOOOOO
this remains my favourite osu! bug of all time
lmao
i might upload this replay on youtube because the shaking at the end is absolutely hilarious
this map has a cheated score in #1 since 2008 LMAO

also he apparently wasn't too nice on his userpage as well
"theres this guy that kept mentioning how bad my maps are in #osu every day, so I ignorelisted him 3 years ago, apparently hes still doing it"
you know youre relevant again when hata tries to roast you
WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING TONIGHT AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA
"lmao i actually got pp from this (last combo misses btw)  would be cool if i got a video, i think this score is pretty relevant"

yo @ToybickIer @MillhioreF how is this
absolutely kill me for the sake of god
what is happening lmao
holy shit i just #1'd my favourite 2008 map   life is so good
playing old maps makes me happy :)
old pack adventure in a nutshell (occasionally add toy in #1 with hddt SS and better spin)
"ok i can tap again, it was a driver issue. thank god"
does anyone else have trouble with the newest huion drivers and tapping? im starting to think this is a driver issue
I wonder if this can get loved even though the mapset holder isn't really active anymore (would need 8 more favs)
"link for whoever isn't aware yet, i've been doing this since 2014 but stopped after a while, i'll be back to it now"
i'm officially back to the pack thing :) www will probably reach me in 2 days as he's doing 3-4 packs per day and i do pmuch 1 per week tho
"the maps themselves arent bad but it's kinda like playing syobon action, you have to fuck up 5 times in a stupid part to get it right"
people who say djpop maps are good clearly have never tried to fc any djpop map with good acc
i love cats they are nice and cute how can you not love this little friend

fuck osu
just got my first mass downvoted comment on reddit :(
i want a nice red flair on reddit too
over the past 2 days i've learned that people in the internet hates brazil and all brazilians because some brazilians are bad XD
its hard to make epilogues work in cartoons and even gravity falls didn't try it. mad respect for jg quintel.
"dont wanna spoil anything but it's just so shocking, in a way, what they did in the ending, its certainly not what cartoons do at all"
i just watched the last episode of regular show and i want to cry my eyes out
"Finally done with that piece of worthless junk. Crap, Mazzerin, when you started making things like Those whom from the Heavens came and Th"

"""all brazilians are racists, this is why brazil is such a shithole that needs to be nuked"" good logic there my friend"
hey guys we need 25sp to get this loved   let's get this gem in the place it deserves
fucking finally
pitch fucker is a nice map/song but i wish i could play the spaced streams
i never cared about touchscreen players but seeing the fool moon night scoreboard makes me a bit annoyed lol
lmao i just SS'd the bumblefuck ending after a 3k combo run on pt. 2 i feel fucking good
"improved acc, same combo lol"
can we nerf od9 pp? i think its a bit unfair that a 4* od9 map gives the same amount of pp as a 6* od7 map
"why is it that everytime i want to use country rankings, it simply doesn't work"
HolyCOW
ar8 dt is officially too fast for me
i need to get back to playing old map adventure
you know i would have liked undertale if every single person on the internet didnt spoil everything before i even got to play the game
when you look at the mirror and all you see is low budget azer ;/
it's funny when you're having an alright day and then you see something osu!-related and your day instantly turns to shit
i want a hentai girl for me to make me happy i want her so i can stop using my hand every single day while watching anime
man i miss larto :(
"here's the unfinished map i mapped in these 2 hours btw, nothing special but again it was just for chillin"
ok this was a pretty chill stream even though im dying of exhaustion and my voice sounded like a robot but thats fine it was cool
k im giving this a try   ill probably mute mic if OhMyDog starts happening because yeah no one wants to listen to that
ok this might actually be happening
i finally feel slightly confident about mapping again. i would probably stream what im trying to map right now if i didnt have shit internet
nvm its pretty good
i miss clipconverter because youtube2mp3 sucks
why cant i connect to bancho btw :(
sorry @handsomeosu for being a prick about your shounen radio map a few years ago btw
"""old maps are much better than new maps! i love chocobo and uh... idk... djpop maps!! they were the best!! yeah old maps rule!"""
"also quick reminder that oddloop should not be treated as an ""oldstyle map"" just because it has low AR and square mapping"
like seriously it wasnt even relevant to osu lol
why are people posting my tweets to reddit...
this is just rly personal but i dont like how he tries to make the songs sound sentimental w/ the chord progressions &amp; stuff meh
tbh this new TQBF album is just harsh noise over random synths and overly autotuned vocals xd sad to see how bad renard has fallen
apparently renard remade pacemaker :thinking:
"ok this is kind of my second attempt at making something. honestly i'm just mapping like i normally would, but ok"
it was realy fun knowing you guys hope we can meet up more!!
i liked mapping more when i didnt need to care about every single angle for every note i put while still regarding intensity &amp; structure :/
so yeah the yuaru map was a complete failure XD im just gonna go back to mapping 2011 styled stuff
im tired of remapping
vinxis teach me how to map plz ;/
(ironically XD!)
osu makes me hate myself XD
mapping is stressful
Cycling is fun! Forget SURFing!  You missed the POKéMON!
the actual reason why i'm not confident with my mapping is because i got like 40th place in the only MBC i participated :thinking:
people thinking if promethean kings fc is possible while i'm thinking about when will someone FC dogadon with DT
what do you do if you're having a bad day and it's been like 20 days already
one day i wanna be like professionalbox
had a nice 98% before full 100'ing all the streams at the end :(
&gt;when your rhythm games are so bad that you have more fun shittalking osu! than actually playing your game
"ok in the end I feel like I didn't accomplish much with the yuaru map. Most I got from it was comments like ""go back to your comfort zone""."
mapping is hard :(
i hate torrents
just made a SICK play on LEAGUE OF LEGENDS
I DONT WANNA CLICK ON THE ORANGE CURSOR SOMEONE HELP ME PLZ CALL COOKIEZI AND MAKE HIM PLAY THE REST OF THE MAP FOR ME THANKS
"20 minutes until midnight osu!server time, idk what to expect for april fools this year tbh"
:(
reading your own answers from ask.fm 4 years ago is a great way to cringe until you die
that miss though 😢
HOLY SHIT IM SHAKIGN SO MUCH
does anyone know how to keep mapping structure without abusing shapes/symmetry? ;/
"im not the biggest ""square meme"" fan myself but i'm actually struggling to find a way to map 1/2 buildups without squares :("
sounds cool
seems like i still have a lot to learn :( . still looking for some feedback though. just please remember that modern mapping =/= pp mapping!
so uhm this is my first official attempt at mapping something modern. hope you guys enjoy!   feedback needed :D
"so yeah, thanks everyone who helped me. i'll be fine, and thanks to your help i'll keep doing my best to not feel bad again. &lt;3"
"seriously, been getting a lot of heartwarming messages. as much as i didn't want the attention, i certainly got such a positive response."
didn't really want to get all sentimental again but i don't think i had a chance to thank you guys for all the positiveness last few days &lt;3
im at the bus and the driver is currently blasting evanescence max-volume at the radio i love brazil
getting some good ideas from pishi's new video   . maybe i should try mapping some more jap stuff
oh how things change in a matter of months :^)
how much do i need to pay rlc and skystar for them to be my mentors 🤔🤔🤔
saddest beat map ever!!! 😢😢😢😭😭😭😭 like if u agree (&amp; subscribe to my channel)
how the actual fuck do you map technical stuff wtf i've been trying for 3 hours and i got 20 seconds done of the CALM PART
"if there's anyone experienced enough willing to help with that, i'll be glad"
biggest goal atm: learn technical mapping and properly understand angles/intensity mapping so i can make my maps more modern. srs btw
coming soon to your youtube recommended videos
🤔
i was actually looking forward to the mapping discussion lol too bad its probably not ever happening again xd
someone spammed the osu!live discord with porn and now osulive is banned from twitch
"btw mapping dracula for because maybe pt1 is gonna be a pain in the ass, this song fucking sucks lol"
still i learned a lot from this thing. &amp; today i actually felt motivated to try mapping something. ty a lot for all the support.
"i didnt want to end up as the guy who ""keeps feeling bad &amp; think they suck &amp; fishes for attention"" xd i actually dislike attention a lot"
so uh i tend to have lots of breakdowns but i do everything to not make them public. last time i fucked up. this shouldnt happen again sorry
sorry :( i'll be back
sry for my english-speaking followers for the past few tweets. just dont really feel like tweeting about this in english.
coloquei o que eu penso na minha userpage. esses pensamentos já tão na minha cabeça faz meses e acho q eles não vão mais sair.
"eu sempre penso na expressão ""washed up"" pra se referir a mim mesmo no osu!, mas na vdd essa expressão serve pra pessoas que já foram boas"
honestamente considerando largar o twitter e parar de me comunicar com a comunidade do osu tirando meus amigos. não vejo mais muita vantagem
"eu sou péssimo em largar as coisas que eu gosto, mesmo sendo algo prejudicial e isso me ferra todos os dias"
Seeing the aspire entries made that feeling much stronger: people are constantly pushing the boundaries of mapping and I'm still like this
The only thing I feel capable of doing is joke maps or shit like that because these don't really require quality or anything people expect
I guess I finally realized that I'm so behind in the mapping sense that it feels like everything I try to do is outdated/nothing special
k I didn't really feel like making this public for some time but I feel completely incapable of mapping anything for the past 3 months or so
quick reminder that a map with a SB w/ tons of references to the hiroshima/nagasaki bombs is ranked on a weaboo game
reddit thread reminded me of this map:   if you like 2011/galv/dnb styles and havent played it yet: PLAY IT.
just got to try it out on the editor and it looks/plays fucking terrible
so for the past days i had the coolest mapping idea in my head and it would make the best gimmick of 2017
nice play on big money but has anyone passed the audiosurf map yet
someone give me $8 on paypal so i can change my osu username as well
ok @fieryrage_ you asked for it
"fiery took my #1, quitting osu! forever goodbye"
"&gt;that tfw when its raining but doesnt matter, still 35°C"
"Porto Belo/SC, Brazil"
:]
been having a lot of cool mapping ideas but then i realize i'd have to actually make them work in the editor and i give up
Carnaval is kinda like trying to make your way through london subway on new years except there's loud music
"i know people care more about difficulty than anything else when the reddit post is ""new 7.77* map qualified!"" like whats the song lmao"

"i think i just beat the world record at ""amount of times this person hasn't been able to sleep the night before a nice summer trip"""

You are now ignoring all private messages from everyone except your friends.
loctav is rude to me
everyone complaining about the 2 monstrata maps while I'm here thinking why the unironically WORST MAP OF 2016 got #2
"6-7 years ago i made a ""jump training"" map for myself to maybe pass the map someday. i found the map today and ezdt fc'd it"
just woke up from a dream where loctav silenced me for 300 hours because i didn't know how to park my car properly
uninstalled league because fuck this shitty ass game
"maybe change the name to ""most sp'd maps"" instead of ""loved"", that would be much more accurate as it doesn't reward what ppl actually love"
ok this star priority thing is totally stupid xd it manages to be even worse than the 6*+ fiesta we had earlier
when a new map gets loved and people still haven't HT'd it
i accidentally'd fool moon night
rude tbh
dat slider be THICC 😩😩😩💦💦💦

"ok that was really fun, there were lots of times i just didnt know how to say things in english (also OhMyDog) but i guess i did well!"
bark bark OhMyDog
we're live at   gonna talk about history of mapping with pishi and toy :D
i really hope i dont fuck things up today LOL
WHY THE FUCK IS IT STILL DROPPING FRAMES
ok i have preview disabled so i have no idea if this is working or not
ok maybe opening OBS wasnt the best idea
so i guess im gonna try streaming some osu! with mic to check if my english is in a proper level
why did i find this image at the bottom of my puush account

"if you think seiryu - blue dragon is the first map to be so close to the mapper's name, you haven't seen"
my mom must be the world champion in snoring holy fuckinh shit i literally cannoy sleep with headphones
Epic Gangam Style Airing LIVE on UK Tv! New 2017 Meme
had a great night at the pub in the hotel. fish and chips are god's gift to uk tbh
hotel wifi is much better than airport wifi
london is such a beautiful city
london as fucc
thanks for giving me furry ads france
"i'm actually getting new followers from all of this, you guys must be sadistic (and i appreciate that)"
also the airplane didnt have wifi but it had enya's new album so that was pretty nice
what the fuck blue dragon is qualified
only staying in france for an hour though. our flight to london is almost here
also thanks france for the totally-not-stereotypical welcome
tfw brazil's airport wifi is better than france's
aaaaaand i finally have connection. hello paris
on the flight to paris LETS GOOO
just opened accidentally a nsfw discord channel here in the airport. pretty sure the police is looking after me now
thank god for airport wifi
one more city to the collection  also hi são paulo
"Porto Alegre, Brazil"
i guess twitter eventually got tired of me shitposting and now it doesnt send my tweets anymore
im gonna tweet more in the next 2 weeks than in the entirety of my twitter life until now
almost at the airport!!!  too bad i'll only arrive in london in like 30 hours xd
and yeah i just put a huge mp3 pack with osu! stuff on my phone
reminder to fc Solar with FL when i get back home
also i honestly should be more active in twitter in general b/c i post like once every 3 days to complain about something
honestly at this point i'll just keep tweeting to see all the different cities i can collect with the localization feature
it should be illegal to not have free wifi in a restaurant
as pessoas da minha familia aparentemente gostam de wesley safadão  nunca tive tanto orgulho
"also thanks twitter for telling me where I am, this is actually useful when you're on the road"
"also apparently my mom hears everything i say in my room because she ""just heard me speaking english a few days ago while i was streaming lo"
my phone still doesn't have the thinking emoji and this feels terrible
going to bed. tomorrow is gonna be a busy day! tomorrow i'll prob be posting more to twitter so i have something to do at the airport lol
sorry for complaining so much about this. but trying to get this map ranked changed a lot of my views about mapping itself.
also 24 hours rule prevents me from rushing any BN right now and i'll be leaving tomorrow so that's it pmuch  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
"confirmed that because of a metadata issue, seiryu/bd's bubble will be resetted and i'll need to find another willing BN. guess that's rip!"
"ripple makes me more consistent, who would've thought"
before i leave for 15 days then after the trip my mom will tell me i need to look for a job and stop playing circle clicking anime games xd
today's the last day that i'll be able to get blue dragon ranked
tfw you get shaky while combo'ing a 2011 unranked 5.3* map lol
"posted my opinion on the newly qualified 8.25* map because why not, but then again who cares xd"
this new 8.25* imperial circus map sounds exactly like apparition for weeaboos
op
i'll probably start posting pics &amp; stuff here when i arrive in london :D 2 days left
"for supposedly ""the coldest region of brazil"" im not sure how i feel about 36C"
holy shit why is it SO FUCKING HOT
EVILROGERIOCENI acaba de fazer 10/17/9 de Zed em Howling Abyss #LeagueOfLegends
not officially christmas yet here but merry christmas to everyone!
how do popular mappers get their maps ranked in 3 days if i cant get one ranked in 1 year zzzzzzzzzzZZZZZZZZ
i guess a few more months since some of the diffs need BIG changes and more mods
"probably gonna take a long time before blue dragon gets ranked, new BN found a lot of big issues :/"
"physicality is FINALLY qualified, gj @Silverbawxer"
blue dragon is bubbled LETS FUCKING GO i love bonsai
reminder to never get guest difficulties again
is there anyone who likes S3RL unironically
thingsthathappeneverymonth.jpg
feels good to map in old 2012 renard map style
amazing album in case you've never heard it and you like chiptune/prog-rock based stuff
"tip on how to act nice to someone you respect: do not start a conversation with them by saying ""notice me senpai!!"""
ok who rigged the shigextoy poll
"i remember when mapping pt.3 in 2011 i was like ""nah i dont need to make this map good, it's so long that people won't even care"""
the worst part about mapping because maybe is the fact that i end up developing different styles throughout the making of the map
I might start a series with ranked maps that have visible nipples on the BGs
setting my prorities straight  i mean not so straight
Something really bad happened tonight. I actually loved a japanese song with japanese vocals
you guys are all paying attention to the wrong players tbh
AIR IS LOVED THIS IS THE BEST DAY OF 2016
6am and i havent slept yet because i was looking at pictures of cute ghosts. i definitely lost track of my life
I may or may not have mental issues
friendship ended with vel'koz  mismagius is my new waifu
"new 7.4* star map ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ hope you enjoy, looking for top players playtesting"
nvm i can't stream because shit internet..
mapping stream maybe??
"In case you haven't seen my new map yet, I've uploaded a playthrough of it!"
im officially out of maps to farm
the thing i miss the most in having osu!supporter is having country ranking to not make myself feel like shit getting top 50s
ok lets go!
"possibly gonna start streaming some osu! in a bit :D playing atm, not mapping"
does anyone know other good USAO songs aside from the ranked/loved ones
what the fuck is wrong with me
"just had a dream where shavitush got me silenced for 20000 minutes because i said ""asdfasdfasdafdfd"" in a public chat 6 months ago"
that's it. 1 day since i'm back to playing and fuck this game
i accidentally doubletapped a stack
end my miserable life
ar9 hd squares are fun
also i wish i could stream league but my 0.9mbps upload connection won't allow it ;/
btw since i have a new power supply that doesn't make annoying background noise i can get back to streaming on twitch now :0
the full version actually sounds pretty good
"at this point i dont even hear ""sakeru sakeru"" anymore, it's just ""fuckyou fuckyou"" to me"
guess i'm back and i'm also going to be the new choke god
power supply arrived but i'll be busy for a while so still wont be back for a few days ):
"i dont really wanna join the reddit discussion but seems like people cant differentiate ""known mappers"" from ""circlejerk mappers"" :/"
"all this speedranking discussion about ""unfairness for famous mappers"" and my map has been bubbled for 2 months LMAO"
day at the park!
so my dad played a song on the radio &amp; started dancing but at the same time big black started playing on my headphones so it was pretty cool
"sorry if I don't answer everyone guys ;_; really too many ppl, but I love you all &lt;3 thanks everyone"
ok guys sorry for spamming I love all of you and thanks everyone &lt;3
im officially 19 now happy bd to bd
#DidYouKnow in the 1940s there used to be a show about 2 osu! mappers fighting each other in hilarious situations!
aaaaaa i ate too much pizza help im dying
"according to the osu! website i'm already 19, yay for timezones :D"
so i wont have pc for my birthday :(
holy shit kashaway actually did it.   i'm the sion btw LOL
that guy from hongkong who had #1 on v^3 2010 is legit just saying
well my pc started making a buzzing noise even after turned off so I'm plugging it off and caling it dead for once. New power supply soon
"Sorry for all the sad stuff today, just really not in a good mood"
...rest in peace :/ today is gonna be a hard day.
can't sleep tonight. i'm just so worried.
Context: Plane with Brazilian soccer team apparently crashed. Not much information atm so it's hard to say.
Holy shit this is just terrible news. #ForçaChape Hopefully everyone is okay.
1 month till im in london :D
reminder that twitter is not allowed for 18/19-year-old people since you can only choose date of birth until 1996
also im kinda dying of starvation here
i havent eaten anything for 18 hours and i'm too lazy to make any food i'm a fucking disgrace
hope blood sugar gets through the voting phase this time :( also really sad that knife party map won't get in for being only 4.9*..
"it doesn't have hitsounds yet, but I gave my best mapping this, at least for once. I hope I can feel proud of it.."
Finally finished the map I wanted to make for the past year and a half. Took a few weeks of inspiration but it really paid off
i found a way to make an extra diff with only 1 note
loool all the salt over a kirby map
vocaloid world cup 2016
smh generic 2015 jump map
sad to see no love for anything older for now but I can understand with the community crying like babies last time lol
brazil was so close :(
well that's a bit harsh
sorry for the harsh words (deleted the tweet) but shittalking owc just because you can't read anything below ar10 is pretty stupid
"""Taiwan and France's match culminated in a fight for the Symphony of the Night, our fabled AR8 tiebreaker. France struggled"" wow unexpected!"
stupidest choke ever fuck my life
oh hey i fc'd tsubaki again lol
just kill me already
"finally got a satisfying score on graces of heaven :D   could've gotten #3 but kinda fucked up at a reverse slider, dooms/gn/maxe 2stronk"
sorry can't hear you guys through my 4 digits here
i honestly feel embarassed about this
end my fucking life
welp
"amazing map, not too bad for a sightread run i guess"
i guess that not being able to read 10.3 as a #1k player is pretty embarassing in 2016 and i feel bad
I WAS PLAYING V^3 AND FORGOT TO FUCKIGN RMEOVE NOFAIL ARE YOUF UVCKIGN KIDDING ME GSAJYHDBAJKYHGY&amp;I*WQED(¨&amp;*WQED¨&amp;*(ESDGW¨*&amp;QWGT¨&amp;Y(SGVBF&amp;DS
Well what the absolute fuck just happened
the clicking sound is the noise my power supply has been doing for the past months while it brutally rapes my cursor btw
so my tablet is bugging hard again and i just realized i spent the moment where it was playable to ez+nc a dt farm map
i finally did my first fc with my bugged-cursor tablet!!! im so proud of myself
i just want my power supply fixed so i can get back to playing properly :(
"but being a progressive mapper isn't too encouraging when you're one, since there will be almost no feedback/acceptance cuz of unpopularity."
this video also reaches to me in a deep level :( lack of motivation (especially to get maps ranked) struck me so hard in the past years.
totally worth the brain damage
Worth map ever The speed is faster than the close circle speed ! 1/10 and the songs isn't match together WTF this songs
"I still think that ""old maps are boring to play and watch"" is a bullshit argument and you're probably salty that you can't play them."
ok after reading smoothie world's opinion about making a mappool I stand corrected.  This is a pretty bad mappool
i feel like having a single mappool with mostly old maps isnt bad. if they keep this for the whole tournament yeah its something to worry.
although i can agree that djpop maps are crap and there are much better old mappers to pick maps from
"you guys sound like the people who post threads on feature requests to ""unrank all old maps because they're not up to today's standards"""
lmao learn to fucking read and play old maps if you wanna consider yourself fucking decent at the game
i love how most people complaining about mappool either joined after 2014 or cant read anything below ar9.3
"he also refused to unsilence people whenever bancho decided to lag &amp; randomly silence whoever spoke in chat, delaying the match even further"
so about the loctav owc drama whenever i played @ owc he was always rushing players and being the no-fun-allowed guy
"just got one of those ""1v1 me bro"" vaynes on the other team, decided to actually accept it. i invited him to a room and he refused o_O"
i can make shitposts too
made a rabbitjumpingstyle map. feel free to grab it before i delete this and proceed to never think about it again
"mapping a ""jump training"" map is actually pretty fun to do lol"
hey guys i'm officially unbanned
i was at 97.5% before the deceit
thanks for the +1 star priority btw pishi
"watching the pishifat loved video made me realize i look like the bad guy for having the most ""loved"" maps lol"
BLITZ AP 2STRONK
i dont care who wins but it would be cool to see the alt-right reactions if hillary wins
its to hot to sleep lmao
managing a map with like 8 guest diffs is kinda hard
its too hot outside fml
like do these people even play their game or do they just stand in a circle and complain about other communities together
"sdvx is literally the worst rhythm game community, all they do is complain abouy ""how osu! steals songs and our brain power meme"""
"since everyone is shittalking the staff can we remember the time the staff ""accidentally"" gave my personal information away"
"this guy clearly power abuses and does stupid shit as an admin, except this time peppy pays him for do that instead of the opposite"
also there's something else i hate about the staff: fuck zallius and everything he did to me while I was BAT (and after)
making the big black 2.0 if you guys pay me enough money
"honestly a bit sad with all of this happening, but i'd be sadder if osu! actually died out because of such a stupid reason"
"people wishing the end of osu! really care more about their personal ""revenge"" than about the structure of an entire community filled w/ppl"
"""i hope osu! dies off because of this corrupt staff"" yeah better let it stay with the private servers ran by previous hackers"
only thing i dont like about the unban thing is that my friend has been waiting for 20 months for unban because of MULTIACCOUNTING
i hate twitter's character limit because most of my messages are like 150 characters long so i end up having to abbreviate/shorten my words
"ppl should be more aware of that while mapping, as it's not just ""creating content for a game"" &amp; works as ""creating it for yourself"" as well"
"mapping makes me happy b/c while i can't play any instrument, making maps is something i can do to appreciate/create content based on a song"
"This clears up a lot of discussion as of ""what's the point of mapping"" and ""maps being objectively good/bad"". 10/10"
So I started watching the pishifat mapping videos and this guy is simply amazing and he's everything I want to be as a mapper and person
i still dont know how/why this happened
im bored
aaaaa
simply amazing
song/map are really cool and it would be nice to see a new map of this song
"this means that it doesnt make much sense to submit your beatmap and put in the description ""going for loved!!!"""
hey guys did you know that loved is for maps that have been long awaited for the community to have leaderboards but couldnt for some reason?
acho que é muito raro eu sentir vontade de fuder com a vida de uma pessoa. hoje foi um desses dias em que realmente quis isso
"well, at least i talked to rafis and he seems pretty chill about it so at least that's good, in his place i'd be losing my shit lol"
I wonder what people will think of Rafis in a few years/after he quits
"he was just ""a noob who spam retried maps to get good scores"" and didn't deserve his rank because he tryharded too much"
"i remember how rrtyui was widely hated by the community for ""trying to be as good as the lord cookiezi"" around '12 and now he's worshipped"
"why exactly are people hating on rafis for trying to get #1 back, at least it's what i get from spectator chat"
VelKozIsMyWaifu acaba de fazer 14/17/5 com Sion em Summoner's Rift #LeagueOfLegends
daily reminder that this BG is in a ranked map
"not really complaining, but there is definitely a relation. but if it's what the community likes who am i to disagree"
interesting to see that the top 4 maps on the loved poll are coincidentally the hardest ones by star rating lol
"last time i complained about it there was some backlash, but.."
aw blood sugar isnt winning this is pretty sad
"im already making my christmas map because in the past 5 years i told myself ""i'll just make it in december"" and never actually map it"
I found my first osu! screenshot ever from around 2008 and of course it fucking had to be about me typing xD
discord reactions are the best thing ever invented
This map has been deleted on the request of its creator. It is no longer available.
tfw your first map was so good it got nuked 20 minutes after submission (I believe it's still a record after 8 years)
Someone actually mapped non-meme (well kinda) brazilian music and it's one of the most amazing things i've seen
"Finally done with that piece of worthless junk. Crap, Mazzerin, when you started making things like Those whom from the Heavens came and The"
so about that rrtyui camellia map i didn't understand what was happening on my screen but it looked nice so i guess it's good
staying w/o computer for 3 months is something that seems possible lately now that im not 100% hooked to osu! &amp; got a decent rank at league
so apparently it's gonna take 3 months to get my power supply fixed or i can just buy a new one for $150
i actually haven't had lunch for the past 3 days or so because im too lazy to eat lmao
im so hungry but there's nothing good to eat besides bananas... living in brazil is hard
fucking end my life
"really wish my pc wasn't bugging out my tablet right now, i feel like i still have a decent aim"
ok this is finished but sadly i'll need to change CS to 7 if i want to get it approved
i just want to get my maps ranked :(
"sorry, had a small breakdown! everything is back up now"
Sorry for making this public. I'll try to be less of a douchebag and realize that bringing more negativity to osu isn't the best thing to do
"I mean if this is what people really think of me, I need to stop a bit right now and re-think my way of acting tbh"
"That's all really, I don't see any need to post anything else about that thread"
"BD is an attentionwhore after all, he knows that and he should know better."
"Because when people think of elite-mappers they would probably not think of BD but rather of lfj, RLC, fanzhen, Lan Wings and the likes."
"if BD wasn't the 7* drama mapper of 2012, it would be very unlikely to see that map in the loved section either."
that reddit post on mapping is really nice
lol why is holdin on loved wtg
you either hate me or you like me until you realize why other people hate me
I LOVE THE INTERNET
if i quit osu im gonna map this before doing it
this is so good
猫 シ Corp. is the best music artist ever oh my god I'm sorry for not noticing this before
VelKozIsMyWaifu acaba de fazer 30/9/10 com Vel'Koz em Summoner's Rift #LeagueOfLegends
not even pissed... just sad
legitimately sad at people's ignorance :(
i found out that i can let out my repressed rage by actually shitting on people i despise and deleting my comment before they can read it
im gonna get it fixed which might take some time so this probably means a month or so without pc
"so, i believe people already know that my power supply is currently dying and causing trouble throughout all my equipment (kb/tablet/screen)"
for some reason #727TourCopenhagen is trending here and i almost thought it was some kind of 727 meme
"i honestly feel like my 2 pending maps are ready for ranking, yet i can't do absolutely anything to get them ranked"
"i'm honestly a bit frustrated. how do you get BNs? all i can do is make them say ""yeah i'll check your map after i clean up reqs"" but.. yeah"
holy fuck chippy just because you're not getting enough attention from memeing around it doesnt mean you should pick fights for no reason
"a rate of 40% of maps that people ALWAYS wanted being accepted it pitiful, imagine 10% for other modes, fucking disgusting tbh"
"make it at least 8 maps per round, that way only the ones people actually ignore are going to stay out"
there's so much fucking wrong with this it just hurts
WHY ARE PEOPLE VOTING FOR THE WORST MAP EVER MADE WHY IS THE POLL A 2-CHANCE THING WHY ONLY THE TOP 4 WHY ONLY 1 MAP FOR OTHER MODES WHY WHY
i will not rant about this Loved poll i will not rant about this Loved poll i will not rant i will not rant i will not rant I WILL NOT RANT
computer architecture is so boring help
i need to start using twitter more often
HOOOOOOOLY SHIT FINALLY HAVE MY DRIVING LICENSE. it only took me 6 tries and 10 months!
uwu
"rant over, thanks for 1k follows by the way"
"like seriously the community loves to support ""artistic"" maps but apparently it's only artistic if it's hard enough right guys XD"
"konbini, megamanexe's Shiki map, Fear Factory, pretty much every non-2b map that's amazing but graved is being completely ignored from this"
"im honestly surprised that TLDNE even got chosen, this   deserves much more to be loved but yeah 6*+ maps only sry"
"seriously the whole thing is supposed to reward maps that can't be ranked such as gimmick maps, not just your raikozen/arles generic shit"
i know that it's cool yeah arles maps can be ranked but can you NOT MAKE LISTS OF 200 MAPS THAT DONT HAVE A SINGLE MAP LESS THAN 6 STARS
"it's pretty sad that people are already fucking up the entire point of the ""loved"" system lmao"
hey guys I think you all missed my rants so I'm gonna have a mini-rant here
"so this ""loved"" thing was a bit too sudden"
"tweet em português pq nao to afim de ficar chamando atenção, traduz quem quer e foda-se"
é incrível como eu não consigo ficar um dia sem foder com alguma coisa na minha vida
i just woke up from a dream where @ToybickIer had a youtube series on becoming a pokemon master IRL
why do we have pp mapping and jumps everywhere? because nowadays' mappers never had THIS
i need to uninstall league. having bursts of rage that are keeping me from having any fun... i'm gonna break something soon
not relevant anymore :(
end my miserable life
there are some shitposts i make but i have enough self respect to post these to r/osugame
"feels bad that no matter how much effort i put into mapping, monstrata will have a 100% perfectly calculated map that's better :("
after I posted this I know I won't be holding them for much longer but still worth it
I just want my grandchildren to remember me as the guy who held #1 in all difficulties of a single beatmap
aw there goes my last relevant #1
"theres some sort of electrical interference shit @ my pc.. it makes clicking noises, my monitor is getting random static &amp; tablet flickering"
like my ultimate goal is to stop being a whiny guy who throws opinions around because i get mad about other people's opinions
days without a rant: 1. need to get this to 10 someday
"not in a good mood anymore so if you're a 12yo kid who hates hw because ""they try too hard"" just quit this game no one will miss you"
"anyone looking for calm beatmaps: there's a new gem qualified!   really loved it, this mapper is so good"
"and besides that, I got to chat with some people who didn't agree with the map being ranked and had some nice discussions about it"
I was supposed to make a giant rant about HW haters being bad people but I'm just in a good mood so I guess not today
"ayy (just poking some fun, the guy was pretty lightheaded about it when i approached him)"
aaaand this just happened to me
now you're asking the real questions
Ö
why
i can already feel the pp flow
kill me
"""oh hey i havent played this map in a while, better fix my dt choke on it"" forgot HD on, went with it, and 1st try.."
!
hi
BRASIL PORRA
vdd
let's do this VAI BRASIL
lol
might stream some osu! tonight
i should get some sleep
not feeling well :(
i'll let this stay as a reminder of how much shit i can say when i get angry over stupid reasons
i`m legitimately sorry for what i said a few hours ago i really lost my mind there
ok i'm done ranting sorry for that
"also these kids on reddit ""mapping is so bad nowadays, i miss 2013 mapping!!!"" as if it wasnt the exact same thing you fucking shitlord"
"if these maps didn't exist to begin with, maybe we'd have more high quality stuff being ranked other than edgy kids making 7.5* maps"
"here's a truth for you, accept it or not: arles, caren &amp; amai maps all have terrible tech quality and you only like 'em because cookie does"
ranting on twitter makes everything better since there are no downvotes here
well guess what maybe you new mappers dont fucking deserve any help since all you can do is spam 7* shitty crap
then people go and say 1 day later that mappers only have huge egos and never help newer people
"i make a helpful post that basically gets answered with memes and people disagreeing and saying ""i learned how to map 8* easily so ur wrong"""
the osu! community sure knows how to act like ungrateful little shits towards mappers in general
"yeah downvote me on reddit because i'm a famous mapper, it truly proves your point hehe xd"
replicating mapping styles is the best thing ever
yeah let's just ignore the fact that my most recent map took 7 months to get ranked (3 of them waiting for a BN)
read description plz :)
i was persuaded into not doing it and after the rage burst comes down you know it was a terrible idea
btw for clarification:   thankfully i didn't need to do that and that was a really stupid thing to say
don't talk to me or my #1 ever again
ps. don't take it back please

"btw sry but gonna use twitter account to rant now, since i'll get silenced if i do it in osu! and reddit circlejerk hates me"
"if you wanna hate me, sure, but at least have a decent reason, not ""my friend said you were rude so i think youre rude"""
for some reason if you're slightly known it's obligatory that people have a negative opinion towards you for the most pathetic reasons
"and now that I care about my own image I'm an attentionwhore, seriously go fuck yourself dear internet"
I'm always beign as spontaneous as possible and I even tried to improve my attitude towards ppl so I wouldn't have a negative 'image'
"I swear I'm getting fed up with this ""boohoo you're such an attentionwhore"" it's not like i fucking asked for the attention you guys give me"
"""if you werent a known mapper no1 would care about your attwhoring"" holy shit if i werent a known guy no one would have a prob with me ffs"
time to remap rainbow tylenol
"I can't hear this song anymore without hearing ""exgon give it to ya"""
"so I'm at uni, in charge of installing an app in volunteers' phones who will be participating in the event"
man it feels good when the memes are intricated into your own essence and soul
feelsbadman
when you want to upload something and you send the wrong file
"i guess i'm the new azer, now everytime i comment something on reddit people are like ""wow bd such an attentionwhore fuck off"""
I have a tendency to make spreadsheets when I'm bored. too bad they're never about anything useful
"just woke up, i dont wanna go to work today zzzzZzzz just kidding sorry mom"
when life gives you lemons..
help there's a guy trying to roleplay with me by pm he keeps saying stuff like /me growls and /me meows

let this be the day when i mapped a tv size pp jump anime map
lets go im mapping anime
i think im gonna stream some mapping
welp i'm mapping a tv size anime song for the first time in 6 years

WHY DO I GET SO FUCKING TILTED PLAYING LEAGU EUYADSEIJOEDSDAWGSETUSWHEKOLE
yay
"I'm considering to pick up and play Myst for the first time, seems like a cool game"
mapping at work is a good way to get time to pass
now i remind myself why i didn't use twitter for long. my life is boring as shit so i just like other people's tweets and reply to them
this coming from someone who should be concerned since Zallius has always had his eyes on me and now he probably knows what I fap to
so am I the only one who doesn't give many fucks about the whole osu! leak thing other than being salty about people ruining the game
i hate it when i'm alone at the bus stop because I look at the phone for amoment and oh shit there goes my bus
fuck its 3pm already fuck fuck im late
i love waking up at 2pm
no idea of who are 90% of the people i'm following right now lmao
might as well update my stuff and just go on with it lol
"apparently lots of osu! people are following this now, eh, i used this thing to talk to the br ytp community a few yrs ago so idk"
lol

Enfim. Comecei o dia do amigo brigando com todo mundo. Ótimo jeito.
Não quero ficar com briguinhas infantis com ninguém por causa de uma merda que aconteceu comigo. Apenas peço desculpas a todos / ao Jace.
Peço desculpas ao @JaceTeddy por minha atitude infantil hoje mais cedo. Tive alguns problemas e acabei descontando no Twitter. Desculpem.
