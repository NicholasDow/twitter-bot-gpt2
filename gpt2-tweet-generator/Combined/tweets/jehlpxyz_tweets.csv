i'm completely serious

i tried doing small tests with @ernperent added but it kept creating tweets with the n word in them

"I think we have enough content as of now to keep the account going for a respectable period of time, but we want it to be as good as possible and the more data the better"

we trained @DeepAireuBot over ~18000 tweets between the four of us‚Äî if there‚Äôs anyone whose tweets we should add to the training data let me know

i clicked the google sheets linked in your profile and it literally gave me anxiety

question @Maklovitz_osu how many hours a day do you tend to your google sheets i need to know

"does anyone have any idea how to scrape all tweets from a user, i've been trying and failing for nearly 3 hours now. the 3200 limit on the API is so annoying"

it‚Äôs like if you have 3 kids and are at work all day for years then come back 5 years later to see one kid dead and 2 addicted to drugs. that‚Äôs what osu is lol

"If u think about it, games either are ruled with an iron fist by the devs (see league of legends) or are a symbiotic relationship between the players and the creators. osu is neither- theres the dev bubble and the player bubble which REFUSE to interact with one another"

Ngl I think most of the issues with the game are tangentially related to this- he put all his eggs in the lazer basket and completely neglected the contributions of the community in a community driven game. this pretty much allowed us to do whatever we wanted (which is BAD)

This may be dragging the thread but I actually am pretty surprised peppy hasn‚Äôt reached out to the creators of things like osu!plus/osu!stats/boatbot to make those utilities official. if he can get hundreds of FAs i‚Äôm sure he can get co-ownership of a few passion projects

that being said if someone wants to make a discord bot to start tracking player data to have an ‚Äúosu wrapped‚Äù at the end of each month/year that‚Äôd be super sick

imagine if osu had any new features from the past 6 years that don‚Äôt come from discord bots/web extensions

thats like 3 months of discord nitro

this is maybe the least novel statement ever but it reinforced my belief that ‚Äúosu twitter‚Äù is an embarrassing dogpile of people trying to social climb off each other OR just look at memes

i recently told someone i follow a lot of people on here because i‚Äôm interested in what they have to say as opposed to wanting them as a friend and the reaction i got was like if a human could short circuit

what the hell. L is only 1. revolutionary

did you guys have any idea V is only worth 4. crazy shit

I‚Äôm learning the scrabble point values of every letter so I can speak in new cryptic ways

It was indeed very difficult i blundered and only obtained a score of 86% given the relatively short time limit

Did a quiz on sporcle titled ‚ÄúCan you name a Generation 1 Pok√©mon for each Scrabble word value‚Äù

cookiezi

i envy people with weird long names that are difficult to pronounce

i just discovered the ‚Äúü•∏‚Äù emoji today. has anyone ever used this before

im trying so hard

not to beat a dead horse but i think all this irritation with ppy could be significantly reduced in the future if he was open to like a 2-3 hour discord call with a few of us that genuinely care

"one of the weirdest people ever, worth a watch"

the twitter account 727 in roman numerals‚Äô last tweet was on 7/27

i just read the full 25 page pokimane/fed pdf just to feel

the other two are sayonara-bye watercolor 2014 784pp and NDB fnaf 3mod 389pp. i do not know anything other than these

i could literally only tell you the numerical value of 3 scores ever and one of them is bz4d

i just got banned from dean's chat for suggesting he write lazer in javascript

still insane to me that the 6-digit subscriber count replay channel was literally called CP and no one was weirded out enough to push poised to change it

This is literally something an 8 year old says to his mom

i don‚Äôt care whether u like it or not but you are a fully grown adult whining about having to eat the crust on pizza

rewatching the GOAT just to feel

"what does it mean when people say ""your RTs make it so I can't browse twitter in public"". i open this app all the time when im on walks/in restaurants and scroll by sus stuff all the time, it's not like anyone looks"

i am the bone of my piss

just took a piss and thought unlimited bladder works to myself. is this my life from now on

Towards the end one of the guys had to pee and I knew that because he kept saying unlimited bladder works for like 15 minutes

of like the five total people in the theater these two dorks were talking through like a third of it and said ‚ÄúLEWD‚Äù or ‚ÄúHOT‚Äù every time either saber rider or sakura appeared on screen. is this what the normal anime fan is like

yea that was about as close to a 10 as you can get and if you thought otherwise ur trolling

time

the diffs are called browiec's wisdom because he is so wise

absolutely not

it‚Äôs not like anyone actually takes what they say in full seriousness (both ends of the political spectrum included) so i don‚Äôt really get where they get all this traction. are there really thousands of them lurking between the cracks

but seriously what‚Äôs with this insular community of ‚Äúwoke‚Äù 14-16 yr olds with shonen avatars that goes viral every other day talking about something new we can‚Äôt say or do lol

i don‚Äôt think we were this bad when we were 14 right

just did electrical again. can't get enough of this #AmongUs

I am fucking addicted to doing tasks

I played among us for 13 hours every day this summer

in my experience there are serbian people but no one actually lives in serbia

Still extremely confused about the design of the N64 controller. did Nintendo think humans had 3 hands? what was the deal with that thing in the middle

Not me tho I‚Äôm built different

Some of you guys online here are freaks

I havent gone outside since monday only 2 more days until i complete the 1 week challenge

question @ppy are we allowed to retweet KKK propaganda or is it only 2d porn that will get us silenced. just curious

Thinking about retweeting some serious NSFW stuff to get under mr. herbert‚Äôs skin üòà

"I also brought her to an anime shop and suggested she buy a funko pop, but she refused. I tried so hard too"

good post/changes but this was a lol from me

telling people to look up lovecraft‚Äôs cat‚Äôs name to show off how based my knowledge is

ok full disclosure i never actually finished kaguya s2

The first guy to push it out in an anime context must have been very brave

Real question how did tentacle porn take off. What was the genesis

Can you imagine following a private account having a mental breakdown and downvoting all their tweets

"damn first time ive been under 100 #1s in years, even tho i tell myself i haven‚Äôt quit i guess i‚Äôm starting to subconsciously"

interesting trends this evening

what the hell is this story thing on the top of my screen

i think a bunch of minors should start using the sam hyde drivers license pic for their BN application

Tbh I see lots of similarities between myself and Terry Davis

kinda messed up that i‚Äôve probably spent 4-digit hours here over the course of this decade when i could have spent that time playing league of legends instead

i love league of legends and among us they are my two favorite games

yes and

clobbered

I‚Äôm listening to Skin To Bone on loop i will never stop

I‚Äôm listening to linkin park while people are DMing me about pedophilia and honestly chester is more important to me than replying rn

"there is no way to actually shun pedophiles/general bad people from any ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù. the approach rather is to not act as a magnet for new ones in the future. but with such a dense, young, playerbase, i hate to break it to you... 3/3"

"if we define ‚Äúcommunity member‚Äù as someone that interacts with other players, disallowing them from interacting, without dev interference, requires EVERY SINGLE PERSON to have an exhaustive and up to date list of who is/isn‚Äôt morally righteous, which is just unreasonable 2/"

"this is a weird take to me because it implies the ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù (whatever the hell that means) has a say in who is or isnt part of it. if we define it as someone that plays the game, that‚Äôs an out-of-hand dev issue. 1/"

if cookiezi was outed as a pedophile i would offer my account to the flames so that his may survive

was there a change to being able to see post history? @ephemeralis

"Maybe i'm just old and idk how to navigate the new site but  I'm trying to find a specific *very old* forum post and it seems like 1500 posts from a specific user are hidden/blacklisted in the forum search?   searching their name only yields 6 posts, all post 2014"

having a serious velma i cant find my glasses moment

it‚Äôs all ogre now

anyone here been playing a lot?

"i dont have Cold War but spent a bit of today watching zombies streams. looks like they removed most of the complexity of the game and it kinda has a bo1/bo2 vibe again, which is good maybe? the one map doesn't look all too interesting though, probably still would prefer bo3"

"dont they say that actual pedophiles self insert as kids, like michael jackson making neverland etc"

"""And I try not to buy candy for every meal, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said there weren‚Äôt days ‚Äî many days, in fact ‚Äî in which I do buy candy for nearly every meal"" LOL"

somehow doesnt surprise me that this guys a pedophile given that he openly writes like this on   and mapped i love egg at age 25

i am not dan balan (common mistake)

what does this mean

poggers

why did we all collectively just accept that the US army has an esports team

until people start playing more than 4h a day

thinking about it and i have the most s ranks of any jewish person

"its always so weird when people refer to the ""osu community"" because in my mind this game has always been like 4 or 5 adjacent friend groups and some asian people"

so many great maps in 2020 with unbearably awful songs attached

watashi online

very normal dm

"i think viewing people as ""accounts"" is your first mistake though OP"

"i fb ""small accounts"" but never the ones that delete their tweets lol"

EU people dont count

who up

time

the chillsahil theorem: at 6500 combo your score goes backwards

"osu fact: score is completely independent from combo, and numbers like OD and CS actually serve as artificial multipliers for score (which is why easy diffs give much less score than hard maps of equal length)  second osu fact: this account sucks"

time for the monthly rewatch/listen:

im egg

Wow is the ps5 really 800$ lol

"many indie games and things like touhou interspersed throughout but as much as i adore lots of them, i dont choose any to define me"

"2005-2010 pretty much every nintendo title, lots of time in zelda/metroid/mario 2009 introduced to pokemon 2011 COD zombies 2011-2020 minecraft 2012-2014 borderlands 2  2013-2015 league (also downloaded osu in 2013) 2015 pokemon showdown 2015 started osu seriously  2016+ osu"

im enjoying the mental image of whitecat jumping off moderately sized objects to fort minor remember the name like in those early 2010s youtube parkour montages

this guy is odd

ive been sitting here at max lvl refusing to prestige it doesnt make much sense the more i sit on it

might be time to nuke this account and start newgame+

my username is actually a play on the word jelq

"unless someone has some mensa tier keybinds that makes moving in all 4 directions, tilt in at least 2 directions, A/B/Z, and aiming the wiimote doable, i really cant conceive of a harder star"

"random note: by far (and i seriously mean BY FAR) the hardest star on keyboard is the daredevil comet in slipsand. fireflower is the only thing thats near impossible to control because u need to move, tilt, and aim which is stupid without wiimote, and that boss is all fireflower"

o lol i didnt miss any i forgot about world S u need to do before greens zzz

"took me literally only a day just beat super mario galaxy 2, got 106 stars which means i missed like 10 or so? i guess it's time to do green stars"

should i 100% this game

when you see it

just got my 20th power star #smg2 #videogames #nintendo $LINK

idk if ill keep track of deaths cuz i just died 3 times in hightail falls cuz yoshi is impossible to control on kb ans3 times in that puzzle galaxy to bullshit

this is the hardest ffukcing boss fght in the world

"im a beast just beat world 1  4 deaths: 1 to figuring out my keybinds in the intro area, 2  in rightside down (one cuz outplayed by the mensa-tier gravity switching puzzles and another a crate fell on me) and last in fluffy bluff cuz i forgot how the cloud mechanics worked"

i started pretty much right as i posted this tweet might post progress here too occasionally

wait why the fuck did i waste all my post-pubescent years on rhythm games and anime when i could be doing this instead

"used to watch jeopardy with my dad a lot as a kid, this makes me sad"

in a way i see osu as a worldwide joint effort to do every score possible

"Observation: conscious or not, people have made a serious effort post-2017 to kind of ""100%"" old maps- the only worthwhile scores not done yet everyone knows (big brother, marisa, kanbu, etc). would be cool if people start dedicating time to the next era now, like 2012-2015"

joe biden IS a scorpio... just saying

only isekai besides slime that's good

just finished rezero s2 it's not bad

cant wait for this website tomorrow

what is it with chinese people and having oddly formatted multicolored text scattered throughout their userpages

i would think the game would be at least slightly funnier if you went to a notable top player's profile and they had a QR code as their avatar and this was their userpage

i think osu would be more enjoyable if like 40 of the top 50 players were mainland chinese

i have nightmares about this 7/27 score

idk i might be wrong but u give off the impression that if you saw a dead body you‚Äôd be too squeamish to have sex with it

It unironically seems to me that ryuk is like one of the only top top players that actually enjoys playing

players like bonk make me question if he‚Äôs actually the best in the world at what he does or if players like whitecat/vaxei just dont enjoy the game enough to play things that dont have diff names like [POG MOMENT]

this +hr should be bounty i cant think of a harder doable precision score

LMFAO

it‚Äôs not like im a hateful guy but with how ravenous people are online it‚Äôs really surprising to me people haven‚Äôt torn into him way deeper

it‚Äôs funny that this guy‚Äôs entire schtick for years has been being a MAP ally and relatively speaking he gets extremely minimal hate

reply with an anime ill give opinion on it if ive seen

i have nothing to say on this specific situation but i think the concept of mapping for owc is dumb. there are literally over 70k items in the ranked section why is that not a good enough selection to pick from

!!!!!!!

i just went to take a sip from a snapple but my brain was so out of it i forgot i had a mask on and i spilled snapple on myself ive never suffered greater humiliation

"‚Äúwith protests and women the same advice goes, always stay away from the ho‚Äôs‚Äù is by far the most insane epic rap battle of history lyric ever (gandhi vs MLK)"

am i in 2012

on twitter i mean

is there a banwave

"reddit discourages community though, so twitter is way more fun for meeting new people while reddit is better if you want to actually see a specific kind of post. but reddit is basically a trickle down from twitter, so if you follow the right people i see no reason for reddit"

"commenters in the grand scheme of things are mostly negative people... most ‚Äúdecent‚Äù people lurk. so in a place where commenting is encouraged, there‚Äôs bound to be TONS of toxicity. on paper Reddit is better. imo, small subs are a godsend, but bigger places are so oversaturated"

"Twitter is one of the few services where users can ONLY interact positively to posts (your choices are limited to like/rt), if they want to be negative they‚Äòre forced to comment. this asymmetry is why twitter is how it is, if that‚Äôs a good or bad thing I‚Äôm not sure"

i have the bakabaka mutual so it wasn't completely out of the question but i just played myself

no pokemon that benefits substantially from weather controlling moves is worth using   single battles are absurdly boring (double battles are the only true way to play)  Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness is a sick game

steven lmao there is no room for debate in my mind

"roserade, vespiquen, ambipom, spritomb, gengar, exeggutor, jirachi, slowking also come to mind as pokemon i like too. gen 3-4 was genius"

"super super hard to decide. as a kid i really liked shuckle and ludicolo but once i played mystery dungeon explorers of sky i would probably answer dusknoir?   when i got into competitive though i always based teams around zoroark, he was the most fun to play with for me"

ok i got it this is my best nerve control score ever because aireu started talking about incest and green m&amp;m r34 and i stayed focused

trying to fc a map in voice but they're talking about the specifics of if AOC and vinxis had sex and i just am mindbroken

im really confused by this thread

so your stance is that it‚Äôs fine to be a third party that hosts music but it‚Äôs not fine to stream it..?

hikaru vs obama would be the most insane battle of our generation

LRT holy shit

this AOC stream chat is otherworldly

"did u just refer to one digit addition problems as ""these mfs"""

USA and brazil too but slightly less so i guess. so odd

what's the deal with polish people and old maps

if u fc just awake u will become exempt from this it says so in the fine print

i know if you do an empty quote it's an RT but seriously why

it's actually so unbelievably annoying

at least no bladee

the only music streamers will be allowed to listen to will be monstercat this is literally a dystopian future

ahahahaha

thats an easy fucking sudoku ngl

he must‚Äôve been pulling my leg. what a jokester

lol they pinned this

no way pokimane and the political version of pokimane are playing among us together

I want forums

im rusty...

slowly beginning to think 3d&gt;2d. is this the whitepill

no force on earth is more powerful and efficient than passionate pseudo-NEETs with infinite free time. there will always be some random ass person with a weird IRL backstory that comes up with stuff that‚Äôs pure genius. i respect this

i think online culture centered around video games is so cool because the people that are actually serious have to tangibly figure out how to be better than other people whereas in other cultures the concept of ‚Äúbeing better‚Äù either doesn‚Äôt exist or is largely subjective

my mom would yell upstairs ‚Äúdinner time‚Äù and i would persistently tell her im in the middle of a game and it usually ended up in a screaming match but she always got tired and sometimes i got LP so i think my actions were justified

i miss my dark era where i would skip meals to play league of legends. wish i had that sort of dedication now

i think we should cancel @Breeze4242 (NDB). he told me recently he once viewed an animal with ‚Äúeyes of lust‚Äù. sickening behavior on here i swear

"there are honestly a decent amount for me, one that came to mind just now was i think bahamete (?) tweeted WAY back that you're decent at the game if you can fc something no one can DT and that definition has stuck with me"

are there any random things some players said from years ago that stuck with you that you're almost sure they've forgotten

osu unironic idea: 10% pp bonus to the first score (per mod combo) on a map to get to the last 2% of objects without missing and the score is flagged with a ‚ÄúBONUS‚Äù tag. HOWEVER the score gets recalc‚Äôd one year later with the bonus removed to incentivize in-the-moment competition

i would quit too

No we have tap water we're just the best country in the world so we often indulge in delicacies

there are a lot of lower level leaderboard players that crowd diffs &lt;5 stars but on more obscure/difficult maps country boards are extremely free

USA leaderboards would unironically be super barren without woey and toy despite the country's massive playerbase

"the reason the tolkien universe is so captivating is because of the incredible worldbuilding, and not to mention the lotr story itself is fantastic, and i assure you boobs don't enhance the plot. i dont mind when people pander to the lowest common denominator, but for lotr.. cmon"

do they not realize the reason people condescend on mainstream entertainment is because shows/movies now largely go out of their way to fill time with literally anything besides interesting plot

personally i think map submission should be a supporter only feature

biden would play for leaderboards on hard diffs

joe biden vs donald trump on howling abyss would be interesting as well

quick poll

I apologize for my previous deception. FGSky does not look like big chungus

I just saw the FGSky face reveal and WOW he looks just like big chungus

i am a beacon of positivity

i honestly don‚Äôt rlly care if there is a rework or not i‚Äôm just curious about the status of the project since it seemed to randomly go ghost

wasnt there going to be a pp rework what happened to that

"it's up to you if you like them or not- but being shocked that this is ranked is really weird to me given that literally the most uncomfortable stuff gets passed through. only people that play new maps &amp; other mappers see these maps though, so they largely go under the radar"

people (a lot of players) are seriously stuck in 2017 with mapping ideology. we have moved past the era where every pattern has to be perfectly playable. go download new maps. half the 6 stars from this year have absolutely batshit crazy patterns that make this look normal

if this map wasnt worth pp this wouldn't even be a discussion

yes i am above the age of nine

It doesnt work with just ‚Äúc‚Äù. i need to type it more

"My gut goes to Rizer/Sincuvate, every time i see a map that i think looks incredibly empty and unfun they have hdhr 99.7+ on it"

everyone talks about who‚Äôs the best player at aim maps/speed maps/reading maps/tech maps but what i‚Äôm wondering is who is the most notable player at absolutely brain numbing boring maps. who is the most iconic boring map player

Thinking about the time karthy took my #1 on a 2 star map

lazer will have a new feature every week until the end of time yet somehow never be finished

there are people i‚Äôve seldom talked to since 2016 but we have this unspoken mutual respect for one another and i think that‚Äôs cool

This is me

"‚ÄúIt's scary to me what I could do if i was unbound by a senseless invisible weight dragging me down constantly. Even so this happened, and I'm proud even if this could very well be my last amazing play, a legendary one at that, that I feel it won't ever be beaten.‚Äù -Robert Hulk"

Ok people have been asking me what the True Answer is and I will graciously bestow the knowledge:

they are good play their maps

"did like 3000 playcount this week cuz i hadn't played osu in 6 months &amp; working thru the backlog of all the new maps i missed, so far my favorite mappers as of very recent are mao and iljaaz"

‚Äútiktok famous‚Äù

im built different

ppl are either a complete wreck or strangely put together. i havent seen too many osu people (that are in their  adult lives) that are middle/lower-middle class at all

it‚Äôs really weird how 95% of notable players actually end up being fairly successful and the other 5% are dead by 25

any courage the cowardly doggers in the chat

"some of the most fun i've ever had in this game was spending my days trying to exploit this fun, interesting system. thank you for your service"

i took advice from everyone yesterday and i just took a shower

he ignored me :(

ever since i‚Äôve been associated with osu the phrase ‚Äúmapping elitism‚Äù has been thrown around. where is player elitism. can i start the movement

bird app is my side hustle... pink circle is my main grind

i dont even know who im mutuals with on this app i just follow people i like

so basically fat people are more inclined towards games because they can handle high sens/dpi so much better than thinner people

i feel compelled to hate fat people out of principle but then i remember their predisposition gives them extra stability in their limbs and i can‚Äôt hate

osu riddle: what is the minimum amount of characters you need to type to search for the big black (no other results can come up)   e.g quick afraid = 12 characters

i wonder how many more i can find

i literally dont play this game for 6 months and within a few days of coming back i find a broken new site functionality fr u are all slacking

"I understand using the new site to be ""avant garde/modern"" but when the site i'm being forced to use literally has less functionality than the older one, i'm beginning to think oversights like these don't justify the forced change"

"hi @ppy, on the ranked score leaderboard you used to be able to click on the words above the columns to sort players in different ways (image for new site), like being able to sort players by most playcount. this functionality is no longer in the game, and i was wondering why"

i guess we can‚Äôt see the gekis and katus that way...

i never understand why people scorepost with the score screen as opposed to a picture in song select with leaderboard showing

"I swear to god people at least used to make jokes about pedophilia/anime but they think ""osu"" in itself is an own now. it's crazy"

"Where is the punch line. cmon. im waiting. this isn't even a joke. you literally just tweeted ""osu"""

this fucking retard tells me to go #1 a map and takes it while im mid-play

i respect every player that has boundary of space in their top plays

idc if my friends wont play minecraft with me for 10 hours every day for a month they are fake

i relate to the guy in the post because it seems he understands his limits just like i do

i throw my macbook across my room very frequently when moving from my desk to my bed. it‚Äôs a skill with a seriously high skill floor that many overlook

some of these private accounts on here are horrifying

you should make a video about it

Yes it is funny

*opens game and clicks on the collection for songs with artists that start with S* has horrifying energy

"anyone that uses ‚Äúgroup by‚Äù for anything that isnt difficulty, rank achieved, or recently played is a sociopath"

ok

why is it so hard to find 20+ year old people on here that dont want to kill themselves

not a single person validates you outside your ridiculously small bubble and almost 2 years later you still chug along it's really impressive

my question to movement mappers: how do you still have motivation to do what you do when literally every player and mapper hates your content

so far the comments on this one have been particularly funny

doing the cpol challenge where i watch every video in the past week from cpol

general rule of thumb i think is that a game is always dictated by how good the people that play 10h a week are

dont really get the hate because this won‚Äôt change the appeal of pokimane whatsoever but the slow distancing from real cam streams in the IRL section is probably gonna start a weird viewer-streamer disconnect

"Side-note 1.12 is the only redeeming modern version IMO. they allowed custom scripting to be WAY better, advancement overhaul &amp; all modded mc is on this version cuz it made stuff easy to work with. respect to the 1.12 changes"

"Ppl that actually reminisce about beta are weird because nothing was really happening back then. MC is influential and awesome because it‚Äôs the best sandbox ever made, but old MC didnt even deserve to be called a sandbox"

1.8: /execute was added so this is when mapmaking REALLY took off. best version IMO  1.9: Minecraft no longer owned by Notch and the PvP change killed competitive PvP to make the game more child friendly  1.10+ modern MC

"Minecraft version rundown:  everything before 1.0: Lol  1.1-1.3: Cool redstone stuff because no command block, first good LPs (like Etho)  1.4-1.6: barebones command block era, mapmaking really started, sethbling got clout, fairly uneventful time  1.7: Hypixel era, god tier pvp"

I dont

5~ (weird) vs ~5 (correct)

if i was terminally ill i would want people to tweet cookiezi replays at me in my final moments

why did that obra dinn game ever get hyped it sucked

zanki zero arm plot point

going to start replying to random scoreposts with cookiezi replays

i miss doing this

david im coping

need a puzzle game that forces me to solve a cipher related to the geography of the london subway system again

i cant fucking use this account all i see is josh

my BMI is 18 unironically

Sounds like an amazing idea thank you elon

have you seen his shoes tho

this reads like genius level bait but i‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs not

My thai housemate and I were talking about something similar recently actually. he was saying to me that if someone called him a chink hed think they were just stupid but if someone called him a gook he‚Äôd acknowledge they were ‚Äúgood at being racist‚Äù. same kind of thing

if youre gonna be offensive you need at least some nuance which that post lacked in all degrees

that ‚Äúoffensive‚Äù osu collab sucks dick because it‚Äôs too abrasive for reddit and too cringe for imageboards

after i beat ftb interactions my life might become so boring that i‚Äôll go apply for jobs

youtube link to nightcore gangsta's paradise will get more likes

LRT Gomennasai

girls who write tweets that take more than 10 seconds to parse ü§¢

more simply is there magic in the game to you

genuine question to newer players: is there a sense of fascination/wonder when viewing your top player role models? only curious because i remember myself and many people i talked to 5 years ago being completely entranced by www/c whereas now i see idolization as merely fanboying

crying cuz no one can do neomax dt yet

good work team!!!

everyone spectate aireu right now

so like 80% of people because most art is drawn right-facing...?

it would be much nicer if foreign events were more streamlined into my life so i could just passively learn as opposed to actively

"conversely i find it annoying that as an american, the lack of foreign influence makes me feel that i have to very actively go out of my way to be ‚Äúcultured‚Äù"

i s2g i‚Äôve seen this exact tweet 50 times

What is cookiezi‚Äôs secret

good work guys

makes zero sense to me. fucking IIT is arguably the most rigorous technological school in the world which obviously means there's a large inclination towards the computer industry in that country. and yet no gamers...

how come indian people are shit at video games there's like 1.5 billion of them you'd think there'd be at least a few notable ones

2020 is awesome

so fucking bullshit that new players get their history lessons from a guy literally named bruh master L

if i get any sadder i might type in chat

im so depressed im watching mrekk's stream

counting challenge tweet everyone count in replies ill do the first 3

im so tired

i prefer conservative mapping from people like mafiamaster who have literally killed people irl not liberal mapping from people that identify with antifa

"tho whoever wrote this has absolutely no idea what ""meta shift"" even means or if they do know what it means they have no idea how one actually starts"

mapping is inherently a creative process and the female brain is more naturally inclined towards the arts than a man's is :P

"many female mappers i know are actually pretty talented (pandahero, hollow wings to name 2) but i'm fairly certain uc invented their own gender so i can kind of get behind this take"

consider this number: 44727

I agree. I‚Äôd like to believe that if I kept my mouth shut they wouldn‚Äôt be nearly as known as they are

My follower count is a power of 2

pls..

ryan k fc happily ever after

i honestly dont know why there aren't more doubletap speed players there is so much untapped potential

ME interface

#1 and #2 on this map make absolutely zero sense does anyone have the lore

i use light mode twt on desktop actually

When I was 11 I think I discovered imageboards and watched a lot of christian rock AMVs

"thinking about this more seriously this was more a thing when i was 12-13, there was so much theorycrafting about how to grab the middle block in the 5x5 using primitive mc technology and it was honestly very interesting"

redstone smallest 5x5 piston door

I have swag

proof of the speed circlejerk

no it is worse why the fuck are you playing mania when there are literally tens of better games that are the exact same thing at least CTB is original

Every time an osu player follows me I check their top plays. Not like I do anything with this information I just silently judge you all

Alright full disclosure I deactivated this week because I am a pedophile and needed to take time off the internet to seek mental health counseling. However I am now healed and no longer a pedophile #MAPPride

I LOVE SERIAL EXPERIMENTS LAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1

ive been on this account for like 5 minutes and i already see loli pussy on my tl i'm leaving again

My ratio is so freaking good

Hi guys... I just spent the last week in Japan !! Had an absolute blast. Learned some Nihongo (Japanese) and Met some real Otaku (Anime fans). Here is a picture of me and my gf !

wow [-Nightmare-] is playing again that's a name i haven't heard in forever

intimidated most by 900 follower 1500 following anime pfp accounts with very verbose bios containing | / or ‚Ä¢ every 2 to 3 words

He called me a newfag but at least i dont know what skeetless means

so how many of you guys remember that hvick guy

he rted me just to do this what the hell

why are those horrid things called jay avis it makes me sick. why cant a jay avi be something cool like an electric guitar or an eagle

referring to the guy on the left ofc

Good lol if people like you stopped playing then maybe competition would be fun

When people call you e-girl it actually means ‚Äúerotic girl‚Äù as well. Just thought I‚Äôd let you in on the secret

i‚Äôm whitecat

greg

So true ICE T

fuck YandereDev the GregoriusT rabbit hole is ten times deeper

You may refer to me as kitten now

Feeling the avi change but idk what to

"Proposition: in the future, instead of ‚Äúhall of shame‚Äù you call it the dean‚Äôs list @ppy"

e-boyfriend

Also idk if anyone noticed but Adamqs wasn‚Äôt on the list that ppy posted. just some food for thought

i swear if when dean drops the #1001-#9999 hall of shame and guminis is on the list i deactivate

"largely true- but effective, calculated, cheating can help leverage an already good player to a great player in order to pull larger viewer counts, make connections, etc. even if they get busted the physical resources they gained from their elevated social status are still there"

dean may have his quirks but i feel like if we were closer in age and circumstances were different i would vibe with him so hard

Nvm

I legitimately do not remember the last time a video game required me to use such an intense constant use of brain power as I have this last week+ playing interactions and i‚Äôm so into it

Thinking about launchedthousandship rn

Who is the LS of osu

played 70 hours of ftb interactions this past week time to do another 70 this week

judging by the replies already i'm going to guess they don't

do girls like it when you speak in twitch emotes

4000 followers?.... No.... 4000 friends

why are communist countries so good at mapping

"Pfp is robotic, avi has soul"

I really want NO37 to turn out to be a cheater so I can say I knew it 2 years ago when he got #1 on Halcyonic Falcon X - Fallen Blood

LOOOOOL

yo @graph_1234 i dont care about if u cheated or not but was this score legit

I swear I see some streamer tweet ‚ÄúA New Chapter‚Äù with a link to their new streaming link/socials every other day and clearly lots of people seem to care deeply about things like this. Perplexing

How do u guys keep track of what big streamer is on what platform anymore and secondly why do you care

dentist working on my mouth while playing evanescence bring me to life on his phone

top kek

I just saw an account with 98 at the end of their name but ‚Äú17yo‚Äù in their bio and I‚Äôm experiencing cognitive dissonance

I‚Äôm actually 16 it was my birthday last week

Like the only time I remember being wrong (and im still not 100% sure) is with xeltol and he basically surpasses any cheater in ability lmao

absolutely insane to me i thought badgraph was not legit since back in mid 2019 bc of his SS on   and i was proven right again... respect to all those who do replay analysis but when will people learn i have mastered determining if a player‚Äôs vibe is off

holding my own hand to pretend someone cares about me

day 5 of ftb interactions ive gained 2IQ points so far

Starcraft 2 ran so league of legends could walk

im 21 and i cant miss

im legit fuck yes

keanu moment

the comments on this thread are hilarious

Yes in fact I actually have once dedicated 4 hours of my day to a hobby

i hate gaming i dont do that

EliteBrandonNguyen

Yeah I‚Äôm retarded but at least I don‚Äôt have 4000 followers

at least if monetary transactions in video games owned by tencent are banned i can still buy osu supporter

the goat

having a few ‚Äúreddit opinions‚Äù that you are incredibly passionate about is important

seems like corona actually saved a few lives

I can‚Äôt expect a bunch of 16 year olds that don‚Äôt know each other to meet up IRL and beat each other up/drug each other

One of the biggest downsides of the osu community being so decentralized and overall young now is that you dont hear stories of suspicious shit that happens between players/mappers IRL. Haven‚Äôt heard about deep-community fist fight in quite a while now

this is the future of speed for sure

has anyone considered binding k1 and k2 to USB connected foot-pedals

Noooooo my lock where did it go

really excited to grind this over a couple hundred hours come watch

Lol my following is the weed number

Needless to say the person behind the register couldnt give less of a shit and i walked out

Lmao I just went to get groceries w/o a mask and some white woman said they were gonna call the police on me

What if they made a sequel to 8 Mile and Ninja was the main character

i hope trump goes through with banning tiktok from the US

if im being honest with myself probably dark/fairy

Elon havr you listened to Bangarang before it is a bit underground but one of my all time favorites

saw a guy at my local deli wearing a triforce t-shirt so i decided to do takeout instead of eating there

if you could get any one follow on twitter who would you pick

boxbox has played more osu this week than micca has in his life

"The latter is something that almost never has to happen, so I just don‚Äôt have the data to make an accurate assessment of this"

"The concept of reverse-doxxing has always been interesting to me. I wonder on average if it is harder to find out someone‚Äôs IRL info given nothing but their online accounts, OR find someone‚Äôs online accounts given nothing but IRL info &amp; their real-name social media"

All my opinions are basically just more nuanced versions of things Arakune said 4 years ago

Ngl this lines up with many other things too‚Äî we tend to figure out how things work before why things work  e.g. we know that the apple falls from the tree but it took a long time before we had any ideas as to why

will not elaborate on this

kind of funny how it‚Äôs really only possible to get good at a game if you obsessively play it through your developmental years yet you can really only understand a game after your developmental years

Furthermore I don't think you can EVER say that someone you only see from a distance is a good person. Like if someone is openly a pedophile or whatever you can say they're bad but seeing GOOD in someone generally requires you to know them on a personal level

"This post irritates me a lot actually because it implies that besides Toy, literally everyone is a piece of shit lmao. no beef against the dude but when the only person you think is a good guy is essentially a PR account you're incredibly shallow"

"You are entitled to this opinion but in 10 years when no one has any privacy anymore, it will all be traced back to the neural net he's training right now with those twitter polls. do not fall victim to deception"

eminem

you would think with the increasing centralization of the internet children wouldnt be the ones in social control

astar please keep up the league tweets and dont let anyone stop you from saying pisslow turborandom

BOOM tetris for jeff

I thought he was a god too which is the best part

"Man I remember watching him play in 2013 between his league games, time flies"

i wont say for obvious reasons but one of the only notable people to graduate from my high school created one of the most hated things online and that's so funny to me

"None of the other games still have a community besides beatmania and DDR, DDR has its fair share of pedos and beatmania players are too nerdy to even approach a girl"

and EBA is there just to make fun of osu yet many people involved with EBA migrated to osu

*clears throat*  no one plays anymore is not even multiplayer and untouched for 15 years (but good game) no one ever played it Very cool game &amp; community  LOL you‚Äôre japanese/wish you were japanese youre a lesbian has more playerbase than the other 7 combined x20

Ninja have you heard of VEVO

my post 2019 knowledge isnt that complete though so i only feel this on stuff from 2007-2018

i really enjoy when scores catch me off guard because i‚Äôve theorycrafted such an absurd amount. when i see people do things/try for things i hadn‚Äôt considered yet it feels cool

lasse deconstruction star dt is when the game ends

how long until we have a single high bpm alt player

‚ÄúI‚Äôll never understand how college and NFL football teams allow kickers that just.... miss... kicks. I feel like there has to be pools of kickers in the USA that won‚Äôt miss simple kicks. Or snappers that won‚Äôt mess the snaps idk man it seems so SILLY.‚Äù

ryan u might have forgotten since xeltol didnt set a 1000pp score today but there are two canadians in the top 10 now

theshadowofdark and americanpenguin (if he even counts) are the only exceptions i can think of off the top of my head

still doesnt change the fact thst people who farm spinner #1s on maps under 3 stars are gay

Youtube‚Äôs deep learning algorithms are beginning to scare me. This ad knows exactly what I want

fr tho of all the many things ive done over the past 5+ years that i deem impressive/cool theres always at least somebody who is *slightly* better. but i think in the grand scheme of ridiculous experiences/‚Äúdeep lore‚Äù not many can compare w me

the first time i interacted with cookiezi he called me retarded

This is so insanely esoteric and occult what the f**k

i unironically do 4

now that xeltol is the best player ever i just want to clarify that i called him a cheater before anyone else (early 2018)

14 months older than the game itself lol

i dont post on reddit because i would own people too easily. here at least i have to work a little bit

why is everyone freaking out over a video game when they could be reading the Bible instead

tbh i think more people could do rog dt if they let go of their pride and doubletapped

and on twitter

fine ill call him xeltol off twitter

this is a rlly cute post because it reminds me of how 13 year old me would think when observing 20+ year old top players in games i was interested in at the time

I don‚Äôt want to see the 100th take on woke culture I want to read about birds being able to see electromagnetic fields

almost every day i go for a decently long walk &amp; the route i typically go on goes right past a cemetery. past week or so there‚Äôs been a (used?) dildo just on the sidewalk by some gravestones and it‚Äôs obvious everyone is walking by it but no one dares to pick it up/throw it out

.@H4ppySt1ck i just redeemed the 5$ domino's gift card

my perception of reality was shattered when i found out not all french people are awful

"note: in a future with more gifted kids that play, getting top 1000 will probably be impossible. but we're nowhere near that yet"

"tl;dr only a very very very small demographic of human is capable of ""getting good"". many of the already good players just tried hard and arent one of the chosen ones. being gene capped is fake bc u can always improve, just at a slower rate"

"lastly i think the amount of people that are actually trying is very very small, lots of people have deluded themselves into thinking they're doing their best but likely aren't. this is ""bad mindset genetics"" i guess. not to mention being unhealthy irl makes it impossible too"

"next, the first point i'll make which is osu-specific, is that we've only begun to realize what ""good practice/routine"" is in the past ~3 years. older players have certainly picked up bad habits and are likely out of the running even if they have natural aptitude. unlucky"

"staying close to your invisible projected skill curve takes daily practice and good routine, but having the MINDSET to do this is also ""genetics"". you can have the most natural aptitude possible, but without the willingness to commit you can't fully realize potential"

"As with most every game/skill, improvement is LOGARITHMIC. u will improve the most at the start, and gradually improve slower and slower. There's also an upper bound that you'll never reach. ""genetics"" determines how steep your initial learning curve is &amp; how high ur upper bound"

"this might be bait, but i see many people not understanding the phrase ""x is genetics"". there are multiple sides to this (stupid) argument, but let me try to explain the ""genetics exist"" side. (THREAD)  Disclaimer I think disagreeing with this is on par with being a flat-earther"

follow @decaedeus i want him to have more motivation to post takes about osu

how awesome would it have been if axarious didnt quit and became the best player ever (which everyone knew he could) so we could have a #1 global named jeff

all of these would be absolutely fantastic but if at any point in time the universally accepted best play in the game is sung by a little japanese girl i WILL kill myself

why is every high level videogame player above the age of 23 from the usa a rapist and or pedophile

there is not a single notable anime character born on juneteenth wth i'm not watching this racist shit anymore

Gonna start muting anyone that puts watermelon breasted 480p shit on my timeline

stop retweeting anime girls that dont look between the ages of 15 and 19

"Coming out as agefluid. The age range you can refer to me with is 17-25, I fluctuate depending on the day. Thank you for understanding"

i watch this video every so often so i don‚Äôt forget my roots

spotify listening party with BD will take 3 years off my life

so what exactly is bad about nightcore

ahhahahaha @Fixxis33 i just ratiod u

i dont trust people who end their tweets/messages with üíÄüíÄüíÄ

"ppl are strongly underestimating their own osu afk hours, you probably have a few thousand more than u think  like my profile says i have 4k hours played but i guarantee i‚Äôve had mt client open in the background for triple that"

"including afk hours, i probably have 10k+ on both osu &amp; minecraft, 4-5k on league (all before 2016), a couple thousand spread over all the pokemon games and like 1.5k on borderlands 2  the amount of games i have 50-200h on tho is ridiculous too"

what game do u have the most hours in and how many hours

im hufflepuff

just followed @AmericanMensa on twitter

this is the fandom that got mad at me for being pro-america on the 4th of july

"It‚Äôs like if an 8-year-old got last place in a youth soccer tournament so their mom made them a paper-mach√© participation trophy, and the next day the kid brought it to school and rubbed it in everyone‚Äôs face"

"the old map scientist archetype has always existed, but especially recently many ppl that embrace this identity are some of the least informed &amp; deluded players that exist"

the emergence of players who try to be interesting before developing any semblance of skill has to be one of the funnier things of 2019 onward

That means I‚Äôm doing my job correctly

unironically my favorite score in a month at least

xilver simp tweet this is so beyond fucked

may

Life my suck but at least I have 5 digit karma

My darkest secret is that I own a MHA t-shirt

My unpopular gaming opinion is that Ninja‚Äôs ‚Äúit‚Äôs just a game‚Äù take is correct

the osu anonymous account has done nothing but make me feel more correct about all of my opinions

Can the mappers that follow me finish this guy‚Äôs legacy and rank touhou hiphop in 2020

Idk whats more insane about this 10 year old forum post- the fact that this spawned a ranked touhou x b.o.b. song or that there was a korean in 2010 posting about the beastie boys

"Also, games that would be impacted the most with a full removal of combat are the worst type of game"

"Unless the combat is presented in such a way that it‚Äôs almost a puzzle‚Äî learning attack patterns, need to jump between frames x and y so you dont get hit and die, using specific items to deal with enemy phases, etc... it does nothing but add game length"

"Combat (shooting, hitting with a sword, jumping on a goomba) is almost always the worst part of a game"

i just peed for a solid minute

im depressed

"Just remembered about this and if this doesn't qualify for ""esoteric osu knowledge"" i doubt anything does"

"there is a ""secret map"" in beatmap pack 162 that is not listed on the site's list of maps for the pack. the map is the only map in osu! history (to my knowledge) that got COMPLETELY nuked for DMCA. It was ranked in 2012 but the beatmap page is completely gone"

After sleeping on it and collecting my thoughts I can honestly say I‚Äôm fully for #KANYE2020

i see no difference between the flashlight mod and the blindness effect in minecraft

snakebird is the hardest game ive ever played

this level is legit not possible i must have tried every possible fuckigng solution

fuck you toy for telling me to play this

i cant believe im struggling on a puzzle game that looks like it was designed for a third grader

i seriously cannot believe i turned my phone off to watch fireworks for 2 hours and i log back on and kanye is running for president

ELON VP PLEASE

I just got on a boat to watch fireworks and another avatar account blocked me

English has Indo-European and Germanic roots don‚Äôt tell me to educate myself when all your facts come from a 5 second google search

they blocked me for this one LMFAOOOO

Im grateful for my family situation because it was just bad enough to make me hyperonline but not so bad that i want to kill myself

i didn't even know avatar twitter existed and why do they not understand that zuko would have had a much more fulfilling life if he went fishing and grilling and trucking more often

me when i see #AllCountriesMatter on my timeline

not so anyone can watch me just so i can watch the vod at a later date

irl stream today where i go walking for miles and yell america

Bikko just wished me happy fourth of july

All I‚Äôm saying is I cannot believe a German has #1 on one and a Brit has #1 on the other this is embarassing to us as a nation

"Will personally paypal 10$ to any American that gets #1 on the top diff of either set of Trey Parker - America, Fuck Yeah today"

"we will only play racially charged maps such as Chris Brown feat Busta Rhymes - Look at me Now, so that the 14-16 year old playerbase that has never gone outside can deeply reflect on their horrible racist actions"

Who wants to host the BLM osu multiplayer lobby to end racism

america day was going SO well too

i know it's america day but i just want to pay respects to nanahira who died at age 28 last july 4th. her music impacted me so deeply

NordVPN

anon show yourself i'll be waiting

what are you going to do waterbend me through the internet

wing my way is definitionally american

zuko died because he abided by inherently asian (NOT AMERICAN) values. if zuko grilled and went hunting and fishing more often he wouldn't have died. fuck you

the only artist that will appear on my spotify today is francis scott key

masturbating to the bill of rights

i'm going to go to the boardwalk today and call fat people elephants to exercise my rights as an american #freespeech

my non american friends retweeted my pro-america tweet but it's ok because hes using a VPN

i love guns and grilling and beer and the statue of liberty and hunting and fishing and the mason dixon line and cars and pornography and football and burgers and george washington and john deere

im already being patriotic

if you aren‚Äôt american don‚Äôt even think about replying to me on america day

so many weird non-events like this that i remember in such extreme detail

"one i vividly remember was cookiezi‚Äôs score on ecology, I was in my dad‚Äôs attic in vc with @Aireuu and @legendcrazyman and aireu started screaming ‚ÄúECOLOGY!!‚Äù over and over  i had no idea what the map even was at the time but even now thats still one of my favorite old map plays"

"i only say 2017 because this instance happened most often in 2017, it still happens every so often"

"for some scores people did back in like 2017, i remember exactly where i was/what i was doing/who i was talking to when they were set"

RT for a follow back

are there any new games like baba is you

can someone explain to me how ‚Äúgrandfathered‚Äù is non-inclusionary language

it‚Äôs like talking to an NPC with 3 dialogue options

"wait so you‚Äôre telling me the game i play, notoriously dubbed for pedophilia, has less pedophiles in the top 1% than literally every mainstream game?"

Timeline dead so I followed Vegan on twitter topics to ween me off this app

i accept the blue whale challenge

how do these accounts find me

I was the first person in the osu! community to hear aireu‚Äôs voice. He was only 13 at the time too (sorry I have to flex this)

What time is it?  -Q

underweight and playing the big black call me slim shady

"Common mistake! Rap God is Marshall‚Äôs only high WPM song, so praising him for speed is a fool‚Äôs take. Mathers has succeeded in his career by being versatile- consistently pumping out content since the 90s. This constitutes READING, not speed."

Eminem would be a reading player for sure

move like 5 inches back and 2 inches to your right next time

i hate seeing posts that are like ‚Äúcan you hear this image‚Äù because i play osu and have built up audio-visual correlations upon THOUSANDS of images. Do you know how hard it is when someone replies with an anime reaction pic and some dumb eroge song starts playing in my head???

no i dont trust the plan fuck thiss

why the fuck is the qanon poland discord server spamming @ everyone every 30 minutes

just finished working out i am so alpha and chad

i think the world would be better if everyone took the meyers briggs personality test and then we killed everyone with a result that starts with E

online: playijg video game idle: bathroom/eating food  ddo not disturb: seriously playing video game  invisible: i never do this

this is why its nigh impossible to ‚Äúknow a lot about osu‚Äù because the amount of time and effort it takes to get to that state of knowledge is just not worth it by any sense of the word

"take i wholeheartedly believe: it is not possible to know anything about the game without serious study- something that is neither playing nor mapping. browsing old forums, scanning thousands of leaderboards, stalking players, etc"

i made it through the hole btw

this is a picture of me from 2008

I‚Äôve been informed Wipeout has not aired since 2014 wtf

if picked as a contestant for Wipeout I would win easily

Lol

ice t fears my power

These promoted tweets are full of deceit

I cannot be fooled that is linear algebra not calculus

I‚Äôm glad my friends validate me

He found my phone number and has been harassing me for the past 6 hours... mental illness i tell you

close enough

still absolutely insane to me that the tetris theme is originally an 1800s russian folk song about some guy seducing a girl and then asking her to fuck him but she says no and then he gets killed in a forest

All the best nintendo games were good because their primary challenges were neither combat nor platforming

Echoes is like one of the best non mario or non zelda games I played during the gamecube/wii era

"Now that I think about it, even tho they were incredibly popular nintendo games, I really haven‚Äôt met many people at all that are sentimental about the metroid prime trilogy at all"

okay corruption isnt bad but it aged horribly in comparison to the other two primes

Metroid Prime 3: Corruption

omit whose im tired

‚ÄúSo basically theres this Korean player whose who set a record score in this rhythm game that was worth 727 points. Yes that record has been beaten hundreds of times but this one time was special. Anyway people on reddit said 727 a lot so I still think it‚Äôs funny 4 years later.‚Äù

challenge: explain ‚Äò727‚Äô to someone ootl without sounding retarded

how desparate can one be

respect @Fixxis33 for gangsta's paradise floating in a sea of anime OPs

Ok hear me out why would anyone play a music game if the music fucking sucks

Mapping for the sole purpose of cool score potential- an untapped oil well. infinite wealth to the first person to repeatedly execute this properly

"Something I have wondered for a while: if people create maps with the sole purpose of a computer evaluating plays on said map highly, what is stopping people from creating maps that can enable scores that the MIND views highly?"

How do I come out as a gamer to my mom

"theres been so much infrastructure in all imaginable types of games so even if something brand new comes out, players with translatable skills will migrate &amp; as a result not everyone starts from square 1, sad"

want to find a fledgeling underdeveloped game with a tight-knit community again but i dont think that exists nor will ever exist again under the current internet

Alright. Emilia &gt; Rem. No question

It has been YEARS and I still get these mac comments. I prefer OSX? I bet most of the people that say ‚ÄúMAC LOL!‚Äù never even had a choice in their OS because their PC was a present from mommy

if you echo a parley that says ‚Äú2k‚Äù would that make you ecco2k

notice how he changed the digits of 727 by one. how clever

I got ZERO echoes on this post. Does no one feel the same way about parler as I do?

follow me on parler

my 0 follower/0 following aes is perfect

I am parleying into the void rn and loving every second of it

follow me on parler @jehlp

ok this one is good

man fuck this

adamqs learning fl (leaked footage)

super fun

retweeting an obviously horrible tweet from a small account is like spawnkilling a 5 year old

How I will remember adamqs

call me maybe still holds up

why is it that many players take an interest in high level mapping yet almost no mappers take an interest in high level playing

I screenshotted this almost a week ago right before i submitted

17*3=51 wtffffffff

600 thousand likes

this is unironic

lookign for smol accounts to follow owo

im never thinking about gaining followers i only think about breaking even with my unfollowers

i would never have IMAGINED there‚Äôd be twewy content in 2020

wait WHAT?

literally nothing ever goes my way

thinking about when 3oh!3 performed at my college and i went to see them just to maybe have the chance of telling them i had a #1 on a song of theirs on osu but i never got to do that i only heard a really muffled Don't Trust Me from like 200 feet away

3oh!3 and linkin park ranked today maybe 2020 song choice isn't dead after all

"ive fully stopped thinking before i post i just type words and none can be attributed to the adjectives ""good"" or ""bad"" they are just my unfiltered thoughts send tweet"

imagine thinking this isnt the best anime song of all time..

james and jay fripside a capella

"are there any podcasts worth listening to, i need to embrace my whiteness"

my stomach hurts from laughing at this

i have said it ad nauseam but cookiezi was the single most aesthetic player to ever play and i hope one of the new superhuman children grows into a player with aesthetics comparable

i use light mode on web and dark mode on mobile

I‚Äôm a cat

i cant believe i abandoned being a high-skill player in a game teeming with egirls for an ultraniche rhythm game filled with incels and sociopaths

ive never seen anime styled fan art of a real human being and thought wow that looks just like him

all i want is the audio feature

reply with your move via quote adam

any cute anime avatars want to erp

hiii

Every day I log on and communicate with people from all around the world. I absorb cultures like a sponge. I am so worldly. Do not consider the fact I never go outside. I have seen it all

All my followers look up to me because I have so much life experience

I would never accept a job that forces me to relocate to somewhere thatd id have bad ping

One of my many unforgivable sins is having a sense of nostalgia for the harry potter series

the only thoughts i have are gaming and send tweet

if snapple facts were actually in fact not facts that would be the greatest psyop of all time

it‚Äôs not me actually

I conclude they are cowards

Also curious that almost every mapper has the most tame account ever

i only follow my frens and people with positive ratios

"No one is arguing the game is dying, it‚Äôs that it‚Äôs losing its identity &amp; is becoming considerably less cool  when lots of different people interact with the same thing, conflicting ideologies force that thing to reduce to its simplest, least offensive form"

oh right i forgot its because people pretend that everyone cares just as much about the game now than they did back then

how come so many more people play the game now than they did a few years ago yet no one makes videos on par with this anymore

i am hated

holy sh*t

Octagon

im going to be the are you winning son stick figure dad in like 20 years

Alright @Kynan383 I challenge you to a game of Operation

one of my quirky traits is knowing all the lyrics to like 5 tenacious d songs

"mafiamaster, kiiwa, loneight, pho also are good"

hard cuz there are probably hundreds of mappers that have at least some stuff i like   elvis (pre 2018) gowww ntr kalibe hw

Hitler wouldn‚Äôt have been able to be nearly as powerful/influential as he was if he wasn‚Äôt extremely charismatic your point sucks

if u are sad perhaps more gaming will fix it

‚Äúhalf an A press‚Äù is esoteric gaming knowledge to reddit

k-on shouldn‚Äôt be relevant enough for someone to even make an ‚Äúunpopular opinion on k-on‚Äù post

"For father‚Äôs day I‚Äôm out with my dad and my step siblings (ages below 10) and my dad got this sick rainbow kite for the kids and it just looks like a pride flag, annoyed that i have to think abt lgbt things when i just wanna fly a cool looking kite"

Wish i could use rainbows on things without it being gay

The world still may end today tho it‚Äôs just that if it did the mayans didnt predict it

these conspiracy theorists claim that we lost 8 years when transitioning from the ethiopian calendar to the gregorian calendar which is just not true at all lol

reading elon musk‚Äôs tweets is so awesome hahaha it‚Äôs so awesome there‚Äôs a 40+ year old guy so in touch with meme culture

Even if i had a gf right now I would ignore them for at least 10 hours a day while i play video games

Mentally ill and happy are not mutually exclusive

I‚Äôm still gifted and I‚Äôm a non-gay capitalist capable of laser focus and am happy

The worst years of my life were 2013-15 and coincidentally all i did during that span of time was play league of legends. Maybe I‚Äôm on to something

you‚Äôre all weird im normal

checking out the chaz rn

as a seattle resident i feel like i should check out the chaz

"decade old for 18+yo, not 18 decades to b clear"

I wonder if these people know about how graphic 18+ decade old JP games are

me james and adamqs when james and i fly to poland in 2022 to go fishing for carp on the szczebrzeszy≈Ñskie river

are being lactose intolerant and being a wow player correlated things or does one cause the other

my life is so awesome rn all i do is sleep game vc drink monster and go on nightwalks

God makes me think my time online is gradually going to decline as a cruel prank because he knows i‚Äôll be here forever

for a solid month i wasnt able to play games for more than a few hours without getting bored/wanting to do other things (watch videos etc) but past week ive somehow found it in me again to full focus things for 10+ hours lets go

competitive games are better when the top level is still really bad

i ordered chipotle under the name gfmrt and when i got my food it was possibly the worst fuck up of an order i've ever seen a delivery service do...  never use god's name in vain. lesson learned

is this francium i cant tell

third pick could be a wildcard for anyone but FNAF and Silent Hill did more for online than all the other games combined

idgaf about smash but man when the onlyfans in bio tells u to give up your dream i laugh a lil. no one makes it to the very top of anything without divine ego or unrealistic goals

loser detected

time for my daily pilgrimage to cvs to buy a monster

mediafire is the newgrounds of file sharing services

"that was a good xeltol score im over it tho, back to minecraft"

how come the one map i dont know everyone else somehow does

lol what

then do not make it a hint just announce it lol it comes off as low effort and stupid

minecraft came out when you were 6

what if cookiezi had a vasectomy

like if u remember

it‚Äôs always liberating when an annoying mutual unfollows because that way you can unfollow without coming off as a dick

usually not a fan of random=funny at all but the compressed putin walking down the hallway gif almost always makes me laugh

Tomorrow I will redeem myself

i accidentally bought the disgusting lemonade iced tea flavor im pissed

My family thinks I am a Morty but I am actually a Rick

I personally would not listen to Skrillex but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre as much of a meme as people make them out to be

is this a struggle tweet

There‚Äôs a CVS about 2 miles away from me and I use it as motivation to do a 4 mile run/walk every day because i go there to get a singular monster energy drink then go home. if i buy more than one at once i wont have motivation to do this daily exercise

im basically a private account with 3700 followers

every day *is* the end goal. spending years of your life trying to cross a finish line that you can‚Äôt even temporally locate just seems depressing. i think i‚Äôve always known this subconsciously but not often put it into words

i think it‚Äôs more important to make an impact on as many people as you can in the moment than to work to be a statue for everyone to look back and reminisce about

slowly coming to terms with the fact that after a certain point everyone is forgotten

Wtf Jacob Morris &amp; David Gray FAs

going to get a fake id just so i can get accepted into mensa again.. need dopamine

'hes the object guy' can get me belly laughing

"there will literally never be a day in the foreseeable future where i dont think about gfmrt and object permanence at least for a moment, my sense of humor has degraded so much"

if this doesn‚Äôt speak volumes about people that have autistically played old maps idk what does... i dub this the yankovic effect

"what is the cutoff time between walk and nightwalk. it‚Äôs like 7pm right now and I‚Äôm heading out, can I call it a nightwalk or not"

replaying imperishable night and crying

coming out as a furry. hope none of u will unfollow

good night please reply to this tweet with ‚Äúnyaa~‚Äù so i sleep well

Let the whitecat fans enjoy whitecat. ppl that actually care to learn about cool shit will likely learn a lot of it on their own. wanting THE BEST SCORE every day is validation of your own ego

"Tbh a score that actually matters only happens max once a week, so getting hung up over the 6/7 that would be forgotten anyway is just misplaced irritation"

Hating score of the day is reddit because even if they posted the best score every day you would still not nearly have the level of esoteric rhythm game knowledge that comes with a half-decade of studying ancient maps and lurking dead chinese forum posts

tweeting about my life and genuine things that interest me as filler between the brainless npc osu tweets that get 500+ likes

"been putting this off forever, might be time"

recently learned that if someone is mad at you on twitter and they have their birthday visible on their profile just tell them you have the same birthday. instantly relieves all tensions

"So yes, there is an ‚Äúinner group‚Äù. But this inner group is no more effective than the individual 20 year old that breaks into his local college database under our name. Although Cicada failed, we stay immovable. Just remember, we do not forget."

"2013 and 2014 yielded similar results. By this time, the people associated with the Anonymous endogroup were unrecognizable from the analogous group of even 2009 or 2010. However the mark of anonymous had been made, many wanted to fit in, and followed in our footsteps."

"It wasn‚Äôt too difficult to set up given our reach. Few of you probably know about the QR code step. Even fewer probably know that each QR code was at most a 1 hour drive from an airport. Few dozen people reached the end of the test, but it seemed no one truly did it alone, anon."

"People progressed with their real lives, leaving many in the dust. Around 2011, we decided the gaps must be filled. We devised a test to find those both similar and dedicated to us. On January 4th, 2012, we made a post on our home, 4chan. You know this test as Cicada 3301."

"I do admit, the old days were very fun. Even though we were all individually anon, camaraderie did form. I made great friends, a group you could say. However, as the net progressed, fewer of us were willing to keep doing it as it was, a) much harder, and b) losing its novelty."

"Anon didn‚Äôt begin as a group as many have noted. Before even my association, a community of mostly mid 20 year olds exchanged messages anonymously. Hacking was simple to the educated in this weak net. This was art, and all works were signed ‚ÄúAnonymous‚Äù, thus birthing the group."

"Hello, I will be providing a thread to explain the intrinsic structure of Anonymous, and give light to a connection that has previously abandoned; Cicada 3301. Myriad disinfo is spreading at impossible speeds, and given the circumstances it is appropriate to divulge few secrets."

"I am an Anonymous higherup. I have been involved in secret 4chan hacking rings since 2009. You'll never know who ""we"" are because we're everywhere. Every text, email, and call you've made we have seen. Like a hydra, cut me down and two appear in my place. Si vis pacem para bellum"

U are so wrong man rohulk matters

Why would Jesus be tied to a cross and killed for his influence if he only 12 followers. much to think about

"Jesus had 12 disciples, not followers. If u knew anything about christianity you‚Äôd know Jesus influenced MANY people during his life. Second, population at 0AD was &lt;300mil, which means his ratio was INSANE. kinda like an 8digit follower account rn. pick up a book dumbass"

I would like to pursue passionate discussion!

Invite me to an anime discord

need 07th expansion gf

just enjoy ur shows and stop looking for hidden meanings that don't exist

"only like &lt;5 anime have plots that could be even considered deep (e.g. shinsekai yori, lain), and it tilts me because when people talk about deep symbolism in stuff like aot/nge, they usually are accidentally falling into the ""the curtains are blue"" analogy"

Take: it's impossible to fully appreciate anything from the science adventure series unless you watched/read it twice

Zanki zero is the only game in recent memory that no one i knew played it but even then it was still a chunsoft title

None because theres at least a small community around everything worthwhile and i don‚Äôt play games that i can‚Äôt talk to people about

when you think about it the internet is just a test to see how efficiently you can learn to consume

Rohulk couldnt imagine it. Robert doesnt EVER miss sliderends üíØ

What if you were one of the most legendary players of all time and went inactive but during your career you made a score so good you made a youtube video titled (My BEST Score) and then one day it became invalidated because of a gameplay element out of your control

Rihanna is my queen

I will come back from 2 months of inactivity to be the first full combo on disturbia

The only game that ever deserved a remaster was spongebob battle for bikini bottom and it's getting one. this is true

WHAT

silksong when

everyone online should go get 4-8 friends and experience this gem

I‚Äôve still never seen a better take on undertale than mine

The things I‚Äôve seen...

Does this mean I can go back and prevent myself from ever playing league of legends

the ‚Äúüç∑‚Äù emoji has so much untapped potential

#*. pain

Ignore the ‚Äú&amp; $‚Äù i fatfingered cuz i just got out of the shower

"especially in gaming heavy online spheres, it is easy to discern between the person who just vibes &amp; # to games even at a lesser level &amp; ‚Äúle epic bronz lol player‚Äù. the latter has a horrible aesthetic, and aesthetic is everything online"

"To an extent, most everyone is anonymous online. You only get your avi, bio, and to lesser extent banner to express yourself. at first impression those are what is associated w you, and ruining your aesthetic is completely shooting yourself in the foot"

Im typically not one to advertise things but as someone that grew up doing puzzles its cool to see a channel approach them in a way thats not too normie or conversely not too boring either

"i generally think most yt content sucks nowadays but most nights before i go to bed i watch a video or two from @crypticcracking, would highly recommend to anyone that likes puzzles/sudoku/chess/using your brain in general"

Not to say being average at a game is a bad thing but publicly flaunting it is extremely cringe imo

"Why do people put their rank of specific videogames in their twitter bio when they‚Äôre average/below average? just makes me think ‚Äúoh not only do you have no life, but you have nothing to show for it either‚Äù"

anyone here play league of legends i'm trying to make friends with more league of legends players it's my favorite game

"i doubt a single person that has been like ""i wont play x because the players are pedophiles"" has actually gotten good at x (&lt;- gaming redpill)"

yeah. the secret to getting better at rhythm games is not giving a fuck about what other players do outside the game and actually focusing on self-improvement instead

set my custom status to this a few hours ago and 6 (six) different people have told me to get help

I will work for twitch and save the internet

u should always follow 5-10 people you absolutely cannot stand

thinking about anime north last year when we all went to get bbq and azer came to our table just to tell us how the nutritional standards of canadian food far surpass those of american food

"i am accepting of everyone with a first name at least as long as mine (3 letters) only people on earth that i hate are people with extremely short names, such as ""ed"""

the more i stare at this the more questions arise in my head

"ppl have been misogynistic, racist, antisemitic in gaming voice chats for over 2 decades. people survived  you say the blanket term ""marginalized community"" but in reality we know EXACTLY which community you're talking about. you are 0.6% of the population, sorry i dont care"

"My water of choice is smart water tho, because i am smart"

Not as bad as people make it out to be

like actually after that score what will there be left to be excited about? i legitimately think that is the true endgame of osu

game ends with chata remind dt i expect we have 1 year left

"When i don‚Äôt like your reply*** dumb typo.,. pain"

few understand this

i like almost all replies to my posts so when u don‚Äôt like ur reply it‚Äôs an implicit dislike btw

she supports the movement

I just explained to my mom what a groyper is

because im the smartest person on this side of twitter

also there are some i def could write about but now im too lazy to think cuz a) it‚Äôs 6am and b) there we‚Äôre a lot of replies to sift thru

"i try to play most everything notable &amp; it‚Äôs probably clear what i like more or less, some games i could easily write a 50 tweet thread about (metroid primes, pokemon series, fallout 3/nv, e.g.) and others writing 1 tweet is hard  it‚Äôs a fun exercise for me though thats for sure"

Im done bestowing my knowledge

reply with a game i‚Äôll give my opinion on it

nooooo i cant follow this account that only tweets stuff i like because of my ratio noooo

"if u start doing this you'll begin to see some players have rivalries/snipebacks rlly often  one that comes to mind for me is Dsan and 5231_Kinoko, so many older maps they have #1 and #2 (or what previously would have been #1 and #2) set within a day from each other"

my ocd osu trait is checking the dates of #1 scores on most maps i scroll by  doing this for 4+ years is why im the psychopath that knows generally what player was playing what kind of map at what point in time

i am ecstatic

im kekistani

on that same note anyone that ever tells me an opinion is ‚Äúbad‚Äù without showing me the light of the ‚Äúgood opinion‚Äù i immediately disregard

"even though we disagree on some points i respect james for actually providing his opinions on zombie maps- enjoyment of zombies maps is incredibly subjective and anyone that simply says ‚Äúbad‚Äù in response with no justifications is a coward- lay your opinions bare, be judged"

Discuss

the more i think abt it the internet kind of got shittier all at the same time; osu was exempt bc of how niche it was. just a matter of time before our virtual quarantine stopped working

"not to say there havent been any happy moments since then- which there were plenty of, but none really relating to the game that'd i'd gush over.. 2016-2018 i felt like there was a moment like that at least once a week"

last time i felt the spark was a 4am vc with james in april 2019 after adam's 2 month hiatus- we watched him play grief and malice 4k in spec for like 2 hours n then went on to do wing my way a few hours later

"this game was magical pre 2018 not because the game was intrinsically different but bc the people themselves made it magical, makes me wish the community wasn't so oversaturated at every stratum of skill, miss the 50 person specs where we hype over a first fc on a 6 star, ya feel"

this is INJUSTICE of unprecedented scale

ok but ep0 was actually just a troll c;h recap i cant wait for this to brutally insult the sciadv vns even more

ONOKEN??????

WATCHING: (only to gatekeep it)

like 60-70% of the time*

"osu twitter is weird bc if i didn't know many ppl's individual contributions to the game, from profiles alone i would struggle differentiating between player A/player B or mapper A/mapper B"

you are not welcome here

i will never be able to game as hard as this guy

"many multiplayer games trick u into thinking they are fun: the games themselves are usually very bland but the social aspect makes up for it, deceiving u"

"games are all unfun unless they are brutally difficult (overcoming hard challenges = dopamine) or is something campaign based &amp; displays creativity u have never seen before, second category rarely has replayability bc the ""wonder"" comes from your first exploration"

Obama‚Äôs ratio sucks dude just stop

ezekiel from total drama island has the record for most posts on r9k

why does chris from total drama island have a villains.fandom page

i miss the times when i would speedrun super mario 63 on newgrounds

The unironic replies to this thread are hilarious bc there are literal adults showing off the fact they know middle school vocab words like ‚Äúindubitably‚Äù

"interesting to think about, this subconscious acknowledgement of cool changes how everyone plays the game. its impossible to be cool on old stuff anymore, and the butterfly effect reshuffles where all the jaded players spend their time"

"this forces said score farmers to play the most modern stuff instead, to be cool. this makes new maps hyper competitive, almost reversing how people played the game for the longest time- the rennaissance era of maps is growing abandoned"

"but like a year ago there was a surge in the playerbase (esp score farmers) and older stuff started getting played a ton, lots of legendary scores were done, were cool, and no one cared abt them again. now that practically every old score is done, theyre no longer cool"

"for the longest time no one played super old or super new maps, old stuff bc no one knew they existed and new stuff bc not many cared to constantly check osudirect daily, most ppl tended to play stuff from like 2012-1 year behind current"

"theres no such thing as a cool score without seeing the leaderboard tbh, things are only ‚Äúcool‚Äù if they havent been done before- if you think otherwise you probably havent played for too long"

Once u reach 3000 followers account gain is meaningless; u already are important enough that growth need not matter. then u can allocate your time to playing games for 14 hours a day so u can be both popular and respected online. few understand this

This isnt cringe because they have a motorcycle with racist things written on it

pain

my back hurts

Unironically think I will shed a tear when it is inevitably gone

"this is the largest reason i think the destruction of the old site is harmful. as much as the game desires growth, doing this effectively destroys one of the greatest longstanding internet archives, or rather one of the last places that truly still feels like old forumbased net"

I think people that just started being online today that get SUPER invested in osu starting now will come out in two years with a more cohesive grasp of the internet as a collective history than many people that actually lived through it

"of course you can never relive old internet, but forums have been preserved since pre 2010, and songs/memes of many different eras are riddled within maps from over all these years. this is something no other game has and why i think it‚Äôs special"

"the more i talk to ppl not affiliated with osu, i realize how ‚Äúonline‚Äù osu really is. the game effectively serves as a self-updating time capsule of post 2005 internet- and due to how international/extensive its history is, we come out super cultured. i take this for granted"

Nicovideo walked so octagoncollaboration could run

"i occasionally rewatch this video and it strangely stirs emotions in me that i cant rlly put words to, so much nostalgia"

Return to tradition

Ur stream kept buffering for me so i couldnt say it in chat

"i call bs because ‚Äúrandom players‚Äù probably have no idea what it means to be able to alternate perfectly  it‚Äôs an acquired skill that takes years ti learn and anyone that actually can do it is a fucking beast (pring, pray, tetla, rustbell, tony, etc...)"

i am the sole follower of @L

thinking about how music has gone downhill since 3oh!3 stopped being popular

what the fuck is this

this sounds heavenly i dont understand

You have to admit he has a sick room though

I dont care what any of you are because I am tsundere... btw..

I am a Tsundere... baka

being completely honest i cannot see the appeal of being a reddit mod. seems like thankless ‚Äúwork‚Äù that‚Äôs both unenjoyable and super exhausting

TLoU gonna be awful? do not care. i have circles and squares

I dont care about all these hyperliberal game developers in 2020 because the only two games i‚Äôve sunk serious hours into over the past year are made by an australian incel and a racist swede

the cookiezi has landed

"But ackshually by stating that ‚Äúyou do not care‚Äù, that implies that in fact indeed YOU do care"

i had no idea that infected mushroom released new stuff in 2020 and it all goes so hard

Oh man do I have news for you

is it such a radical take to think that the witty soft spoken individual is more hype to vc with than someone who is a beacon of spergy noise

when 17 year old 5‚Äô4 timothy is behind HiyokoDesuüß°

i dont trust white ppl with asian screen names

This is like the single worst take i‚Äôve seen on here in weeks üíØ

first like hour was r9k the movie but the back third or so was actually pretty solid

time

if i made one tweet that would make you unfollow me what would it be

excited for the documentary

i think i did that as a placeholder to come back to it but then just never did

"just scanned in one of my assignments for an online class, and afterwards i realized i submitted this"

Wrong account.

thinking about all the people that have seen my dick without knowing that it was my dick

weird to me how some newer people online dont know who leafy is

Idk if i have the control for something so slow

ive been thinking about video game osts a lot recently

transistor soundtrack is slept on

i agree with will. anyone that started harassing lilypichu now is cringe because that implies they weren‚Äôt harassing her before

what's this guys problem

I simply do not care

I will follow you into any battle milady

i would become a north korean citizen just to climb the ladder of power then misbehave on the off chance that Kim Yo-Jong would beat me herself

I am so fucking excited for all the Kim Yo-Jong R34 you guys have no idea

proud to say that the greatest simp on this entire website follows me (jamescagewhite)

LBLJ

There are millions of ppl that would deepthroat jungkook but maybe like 3 kotoko stans max

Like Umineko is the reverse IMO. fucking dopamine 24/7 as you grind through it but now that i look back it kind of blends in with other things that fall in the tier of ‚Äúvery good‚Äù

What are more things that are only moderately enjoyable as you consume them but they magically ascend to godhood after you‚Äôre done... There must be more

Thinking about how chaos;child is a 8/10 as you read it but a 10/10 in retrospect

"i love how frequently big female streamers tweet stuff like ‚Äúeveryone please be nice‚Äù, like they‚Äôre slowly collapsing within their own minds and pleading for help when frankly no one cares"

I would rather be employed than make a linkedin

"üë∂ ‚ÄúIdk much about osu but WubWoofWolf is one of my fav players because i like his stream and YT channel!‚Äù  üßë‚Äçüî¨ ‚ÄúWolf is good but he peaked 5 years ago, he can‚Äôt compete with the best anymore‚Äù [YOU ARE HERE]  üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ‚ÄúWolf is an archmage wizard with an unmatchable skillset‚Äù [I AM HERE]"

aireu was my first redpill

Holy shit Maksim Mrvica FA

like i didnt know bc they took my phone to scan at some machine so i didnt see that he was calling. stupid woey

thinking about twitchcon last year when the people handing out badges took my phone to scan the QR code but the scan kept failing bc woey kept calling my phone interrupting the process but we didnt know so i thought my ticket was invalid wasting 20 minutes of my life

ive been so focused on playing minecraft that i didnt realize i had new divide by linkin park playing on loop in the background for 5 hours

"I'd like to propose some nomenclature for the timeline, B.A. &amp; A.A. (before adamqs deleted his account/after adamqs deleted his account), as that ACTUALLY was the moment the downhill started IMO   proper usage would be something like ""osu came out in 12 B.A."""

reminder octopath traveller ost is the best soundtrack from a game in the past 5 years and no one cared

"I‚Äôve been using macs for as long as I can remember but I just got a PC. i‚Äôm pretty good with computers but i guess im just stupid rn so thought id ask a question here:  my wifi is like 100-200mb down on my laptop/other devices, but this pc barely gets 1-2mb. why is this"

4:47pm

i miss the days when the true rhythm game antagonists were bemani accounts and not the general online left

I just woke up and no one gifted me discord nitro u r all fake

adam delivers

its only been an hour and so many bday wishes- thanks guys. but i doubt ill get a better gift than i got last year

a real human being made this tweet and even thought that stupid unicode font was necessary

if mbomb can get restricted for grooming 13 year old girls can we also restrict animal crossing players because they basically do the same thing

I plan on celebrating my birthday by doing absolutely fucking nothing because i‚Äôm a doomer

also it's one of my oldest friends from this community's birthday too (quincy/cpugeek on osu). he doesnt have a twitter but thought i'd acknowledge him here as well

"it is my birthday   thank you all my friends, old and new, for growing up and sharing experiences with me. I would not be happy getting older if I knew I was aging alone.  to many more years of good health"

From now on as a social experiment I will tweet all my tweets twice but one of them will be accompanied by an anime girl and the other will not

From now on as a social experiment I will tweet all my tweets twice but one of them will be accompanied by an anime girl and the other will not

When I‚Äôm older I want to be white Jimmy Cao

fwiw i'm pretty consistently doing 4-5am to 11-12am

what are ur guys' sleep schedules like rn i'm curious

full disclosure i run struggle tweets

"the fact you went to /r/roastme looking for validation, failed, then went to twitter for your hiveminded 15 year old fanbase to do the same thing speaks greater volumes of your insecurity and is a harder roast than any middleeastern/israeli joke i could say"

so who gonna dt nold‚Äôs dotexe

moooooooooooom jay is tweeting again

"Update: I moved back in with my mom a few weeks ago to escape, but her boyfriend has been commuting to NYC every day and now they both have ‚Äúa cough‚Äù.  Big man up there reaaaalllly is testing me lol"

"this is why normies tilt the hardest, getting shot in call of duty is very high in the list of things done to wrong them at a subconscious level. it‚Äôs conversely why the depressed person can grind runescape for 5 digit amounts of hours"

If u don‚Äôt tilt in games that just means u underwent childhood trauma so extensive that anything virtual is simply not enough to anger you

doing some late night studying

ive realized that during this quarantine i‚Äôm only on here for extended periods of time after 3am because before then im gaming

"Like don‚Äôt get me wrong I think the online lifestyle is beast and is the lifestyle most accustomed to the high iq introvert, but ppl that just spawn here after leading a very cookie cutter childhood have always been odd to me. like How did U get here"

like ‚ÄúHmm yes I have an established irl life going on but I will decide to get into Anime and edating rn for no particular reason even though im 21‚Äù

"i dont understand how people get into online culture after age 20, i think everything here is idiotic but i‚Äôm here because of niche interests i cultivated over years while growing up"

the only device that was saved was my DS bc i refused to have this dumb sticker on it while i played pokemon

when i was younger my mom thought that computers leaked radiation and one of her white middle aged female friends told them to put these weird stickers on all our computers to prevent against radiation poisoning and she did but they were magnets and all our computers were nuked

im getting so old................

"as a result i feel like my resume of game accomplishments/knowledge is so rare in the sense that even tho i was never ‚Äúpro‚Äù anywhere, i got near the top in so many different things + played craploads of noncompetitive stuff, like nintendo games etc"

"when reflecting on these times i realize that i‚Äôm capable of nolifing games more than almost anyone else and only stop really when i learn practically everything there is to know, then move on to the next thing"

"thinking about when i was in highschool like 6 years ago during my league era almost every day i would wake up at 5-6am to watch pro KR games, go to school, then come home and play from 4 to 1am"

"cant wait until this ban is lifted in like 2023 and there appears this arsenal of chinese ubergamers who, for example, make 2010 korea look beatable in starcraft"

Update

playing minecraft with adamqs

Listen I‚Äôm not saying I‚Äôm for racism but if there‚Äôs one race to be racist towards given current events shouldnt it be the chinese

2018 @emperent was peak content

If corona is going to make governments promote edating i never want this to end

LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

"Look at the replies 2 this tweet. i simply say happy birthday (even tho will's bday was in march) and many others blindly hop on board. i am an intellectual powerhouse, i create and spearhead all online movements"

insane how a volcano erupted in indonesia and north korea fired 4 missiles into the sea of japan yesterday and no one cared at all

"this is genius. places like NYC mandate that ppl wear masks at all times, but the kind of mask required is unspecified (they ackshually suggest giving surgical masks to hospitals- not wear them). the rich justaflu horde have a fashionable+pricey option = she's making free money"

ill continue to do this for friends/players i know sorry if i didnt get to u but i have to do things irl (cringe)

reply with your oss profile and i wll tell u what ur most based top play is

lovve visuzal novels

even twitter itself is bullying me

why did no one read baldr sky it's like unarguably one of the top 10 things to come out of japan

el psy congroo is proof that if u say something cringe enough times it becomes based

"when u think about it the greatest player of all time in two gamemodes having usernames that are literally ""cookie z"" and ""extreme gondola"" is pretty fucking retarded"

what if wolfs username was Wubbington and that's what everyone knew him as

scientology time

need to make new pinned thread like flat earth but not flat earth

tired of all these women playing with my emotions

was in the living room with my family today and i threw a wadded up napkin in the trash. i followed it up with ‚ÄúKobe‚Äù and no one bat an eye. have they forgotten

are you kidding me. this suuuuuuucks

one of my favorite things to do on twitter is ironically RTing obvious bait and watching my followers reply in ways that indicate they did not get it whatsoever

listening to nekrogoblikon as i mindlessly refresh twitter reminds me how grateful i am to osu (toy specifically here) for exposing me to soooo much cool music

mindblocked on the shirt folding stage i'll do it next year

have a lot of free time during this quarantine so i think i might do my laundry this year

if twitter was a game map pride accounts would be the water level because everyone has to experience them at some point but no one likes them besides people i hate

"now that i think about it, a heavily advertised cookiezi minecraft stream could pull 10000 viewers easily"

"Im so depressed.., none of my followers follow 1000 people that follow me.. i will promptly deactivate,..,.. blackpill"

"genuinely curious: how many ""followers you know"" appear on my profile"

james is my only equal

like yes we know The Media Is Bad. it seems this was aimed at literally the lowest common denominator

"just watched the Out Of Shadows documentary and i dont get the hype, all i got out of it is that MKUltra was based and Heinrich Himler practiced black magic"

ryuk please....

can someone good dt

its like 6am but the anime girl RTs on my timeline right now are absolutely top tier good work guys

all i did from 11-16 was play pokemon minecraft borderlands 2 and league i really missed out

I wish I was online before i was 16 so I could have stories about being groomed

need gf not because i‚Äôm lonely and longing for attention but because my back hurts and i would like regular massages

i am going to become a higherup in the valorant fanfiction community. wish me luck

What if instead of red and blue the two pills Morpheus handed Neo in the Matrix were pink and purple so being pinkpilled was an unironic thing that people said

currently sporting a very nice beard

Just saw a thread where a midget got offended at the term ‚Äúdwarf star‚Äù

happy easter my friends. to celebrate this holiday i will go outside for 10 (ten) whole minutes

i've played a couple hundred hours of modded minecraft expert packs in the past month and i think i can safely say this is probably one of the most autistic activities you can do on your computer

"Tired of seeing this neekolul girl on my TL, i much preferred the era of Belle Delphine"

Road to 110. need to sacrifice more meals for gaming

I am 115lbs as of right now

"Hello @discord. i have a suggestion for improving your platform: nicknames in DM. When DMing with my internet girlfriend, I would like to see messages from something along the lines of ‚ÄúPrincess ‚ú®üåüüíû‚Äù. This would greatly enhance the user experience. Thanks"

"Shadowbanning is an amazing thing. A big part of shadowbanning is deleting likes. Despite having over 200 million views this month on my Twitter feed with a 6.2% engagement rate and 55,000 impressions per tweet, I still rarely get over 250 likes.  That's the game Twitter plays."

I‚Äôve never raged at a video game. i just play until i start crying

Everything finally makes so much sense

i am so happy my friend Adamqs' account is back. i am moved to tears

replace 1 letter in the first word and it becomes the most insane osu tweet ever

thinking about yelawolf‚Äôs verse in worldwide choppers rn

this site makes me sad because not everyone is wholesome 100 all the time

Whenever I see someone with an anime avi from an anime they havent seen I get mad. Doubly so for egirls

"I am atheist, but I just sent a massive bolt of care your way. Many watts of caring and hope."

"My 3 year old son came up to me the other day and asked ""Father, why do spinners in lazer still give accuracy when there is no rhythmic component associated with them?"" Children these days are so insightful"

might go back to larping as a scientologist

the sunday night mood is using a java applet to run modded minecraft simulations

i give all these people such great content and none of them follow me. my life is so hard

i am a cringelord...

"i didn‚Äôt actually know people liked futa, i thought it was just a meme..."

I am the greatest incel larper of all time

a good read

this is easily my favorite comment on the whole thread

woman giving birth in a forest or something

man getting blowjob from a fish

So if I were to talk to a female I met through twitter for an extended period of time would you guys think less of me

"i must be getting at least one quote tweet per minute on that Zoom tweet, and it made me realize damn I am so much funnier than most of you"

So is your avatar

ive never even seen 5 women before

The amount of humans on earth capable of finding an edate and following through with one is far less than the amount that can date in the traditional manner. any edater is therefore a chosen elite that the populace should learn to unconditionally respect ‚úä

anyone that can decipher this can take my spot in mensa

why did someone screenshot the tweet of mine that bladee liked and put it on /r/sadboys

Pretty bored in quarantine... gonna try picking up anime for the first time. Any recommendations for a newcomer into this media?

a story in 2 tweets

white orange magenta lightblue yellow limegreen pink .... only true gamers know what color comes next..

tweeting is an inferior activity to gaming

i think its funny that anyone can get away with these british accent jokes but the second you start replacing Ls and Rs like you‚Äôre chinese you‚Äôre an insufferable racist

"how are there so many instances of people on this side of twitter grooming underage egirls, i‚Äôve been looking for one for five years and failed miserably"

Thats like their entire population wtf

going to try light mode for one day (24h). if i deactivate within that time you know why

Imagine enjoying factorio

ppl that wear contacts as opposed to glasses are lesser humans

i got removed from the BNG im so depressed

April fools done in style?

today was good because i faked corona symptoms all day long to fuck with my boomer justaflu family

Bladee noticed me

Rabbit died so Zoom could live

"it‚Äôs not a problem with online teaching, it‚Äôs a problem with Zoom. when will they learn this this service is shit and has practically no security"

it seems this player is legitimate... my gut reaction was incorrect. regardless my life is infinitely more stressful now

the way i'm replying to all these people dming me because of the FA newspost is going to make ephemeral regret this april fools joke so bad

"some 50k just cheated a #1 snipe on me on some 2010 map, life as a BN is already more stressful"

Just reported @jehlpzyx for impersonation. there are some sick people out there

3000 followers? No... A cult with 3000 members

also ty for 3k everyone

guys i'm a BN now  this isn't an edited image

no way is this actually worstpolackeu

why is everyone in the replies disregarding that ominous ‚Äúphase 4‚Äù at the end. what is phase 4. will there be a phase 5

"at 1k he posted legs, at 2k he opened a patreon.... what will he do for 3k"

anyways gm im going back to sleep

why did the stupid twitter reply i made before going to sleep being massively upvoted on reddit

that probably comes off as aggressive i like (almost) all the accounts i follow but my tl is dead more than i would like

anyone know any accounts i should follow that i would actually like

"for the first time in a while, the trending tab caught my eye because David Blaine is trending. magic is sick as fuck so i wanted to check out whatever was happening and ALL THE RELATED TWEETS ARE KPOP. why do they have to ruin so many good things"

this is fucking insane

i hope this is me in 40 years

"do what bikko did, but instead of ghosting after all the hard work, be happy with your accomplishments and burn it all to the ground"

"no one knows how to get banned with style. build up your status as a legend with gradual fake improvement over months, years. cheat scores way below your skill level, on interesting maps. then demolish everyone's respect with a truth bomb no one wants to accept. would be amazing"

what did he mean by this

#newbio

#newbanner

#newpfp

"first time masturbating during an online class on Zoom.. I was a bit intimidated to start but once I got into it,it felt pretty natural. I made sure to turn my face away from the camera when I finished too.. Being able to do this while staring at my crush in real time was amazing"

Well if a girl can reach rank 1 on catch the beat how hard can it really be

black sun

Based on this room I thought this would be the perfect egirl to violently stalk but then i realized NO white girl would have that chinese lunar new year heart on their window so i lost interest

everyone that grew up watching veggietales is now part of the online right

i've never seen this one before LOL botania just keeps on giving

"I live in EST. i regularly go to sleep after 3am. I don‚Äôt have anything better to do, I‚Äôm depressed. Is that what you wanted me to say? are you happy now"

About to increase my IQ by another standard deviation

it is my birthday in under a month. what do you guys have planned for me

just saw a tweet that contained all homophones of ‚Äúthere‚Äù and used none of them correctly

i remember one night when i was 15 i was really depressed so i made a deviantart account and the ‚Äúrecommended for you‚Äù tab had meg from family guy pregnancy porn and thats how i got introduced to vore

cant fall asleep because im thinking about the 6+ hour route in the island vn (a story essentially centered around time travel) where u tutor a girl in algebra and thats all that happens

the best part about zoom classes is finding out what the really annoying dude‚Äôs room looks like

ROAD TO 100 HOURS OF MINECRAFT IN A WEEK

i hate that everyone is literally supposed to be staying as germ free as possible yet every time i go downstairs in my own home i feel like this image

thinking about abandoning my anime avi for a pixl avi

storytelling has been the lubricant of society for millennia and for some reason our generation has willed upon the philosophy that delving into fiction is gay and uncool

every person that doesnt like reading is cringe sorry

the fact 3 to 4am is viewed as an anomalous sleeping time further shows how ill adapted these people are to our lifestyle. can this quarantine last forever please

i dont tweet anymore i just play modded minecraft and occasionally reply to people

already covered @FTB__Quarantine

based

"opened up OBS for the first time in forever and just realized this was the most recent stream ""overlay"" i used"

what you call a grind i call an optimization challenge. we are not the same

one day i will post the ultimate osu redpill and twitter will implode. be warned

So how about that net neutrality issue

"whenever i see those substanceless tweets with 6 digit likes by selfie avis i usually react ‚Äúi can tweet something as stupid as that too for likes‚Äù, but when i take a step back and think about i can‚Äôt. my brain is physically incapable of producing such alien, normal thoughts"

"it‚Äôs still fucking mental to me that the big milestone in the progression of that mod is the ‚ÄúPortal to Alfheim‚Äù, which is literally just a SAO reference"

Thinking about the fact that some 13 year old probably got into weeb culture because they were playing the Botania mod in Minecraft and they googled one of the many blocks/items named after something from anime

"any takers (biologically female, white, and below average weight are my requirements)"

"im at least 1 or 2 standard deviations above normal IQ, i‚Äôm a doomer, i have a very wide range of interests, and I am white and super attractive. aside from height, there is nott much more one could want in a relationship"

i think when i eventually ween away from playing games 10+ hours a day and become a little less hyperactive i would be the perfect ebf

few things make me more irritated than the biweekly viral thread where hundreds of adults argue over order of operations

thinking about tweeting tonight

Wrong account

thats why i don‚Äôt play it üíØ

reminder double harmonize shock is the peak of jp cute girl music

wouldn't be surprised at all if ben was an anon account in 2012

only true jehlp fans follow me on 3 accounts

my mom and her boyfriend are hosting a dinner party at my house right now and all these 50 year old white men are yelling in fake chinese accents about eating bats. my days are numbered

lambdadelta deepthroat

"on second thought thats definitely what it is, we'll inevitably peak at some N tests/day, so at ""peak"" we will only see linear growth"

either that or just no one is getting tested because it's too rampant to test everyone

i call bullshit. should be way higher than 500k (this implies logarithmic growth as of recent)

"i'm living with my family again while this whole virus thing goes down and i have 2MB/s down, i can barely do anything online"

"I‚Äôm in Boston and have a few harvard/mit friends. the mit ones are grinding nonstop while the harvard ones are all jacking off in Martha‚Äôs Vineyard, it‚Äôs insane"

"people should know this, i love the concept of the Ivy League"

MORE TIME FOR MINECRAFT LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

I literally see zero downsides to the pandemic

so how much exactly does an egf cost

honestly a much better way to go out

Twitter trends never ceases to amaze

"this may sound oddly specific, but i see lots of tweets now in the vein of ‚Äújust played x for 8 hours... quarantine life hits different‚Äù"

"i dont understand these people supposedly in quarantine ‚Äúflexing‚Äù that they played a whole EIGHT HOURS of games in a day. you are not going outside whatsoever, and spending only half of your waking hours gaming is a lot for you? weak"

taped my door shut. no one enters or leaves.  febreze also added to my battle station

"French bread pizza, water, my daki, laptop, switch, 2 doujins, a loaf of white bread, microwave, paper towels, and a plastic bin to use as my bathroom. i have no need to move more than 6 feet for at least a week  corona do your worst"

Bringing buckets to my room to use as toilets for the next few weeks. the walk down the hall is much too dangerous

im not fucking around anymore

"we only share common facilities like the front patio, garbage bins, washing machine, etc, but still it's enough to require lots of extra day to day care"

"my house is split into two parts, myself and my roommates have the 2nd and 3rd floor while the other people have the first floor. thankfully it's not any of my housemates, but rather the people that live on the first floor... either way life just got much more interesting"

like i'm usually ironic on here but this is 100% serious. why is everyone besides me so stupid

some r*tard that lives in the same house as me unironically has coronavirus. god realized i was too good at this pandemic thing so he put my life on hard mode

i just took a shower for so long that my glasses despawned when i got out

there is something so liberating about waking up at sunset

if i dream of ninja when i wake up im deactivating

this is the last thing i see before going to sleep are u fucking kidding me

i mean sleep* i am going to sleep. say goodnight to me =w=

10am the perfect time for nightcore

osu players will spend thousands of hours listening to the most ear piercing of loli songs yet will still be unable to recognize something as generic as tokyo ghoul

i have gotten word of this myself too. everyone please stock up on food/cleaning supplies ASAP if you haven‚Äôt already

WHO WILL FILL THE VOID PLEASE ROHULK COME BACK

where will i find a streamer that will passionately yell at me for minutes on end because i disagree about something

where will i get to see 99.8 HDHR scores with no sliderends missed on really hard 5 star maps

i just want robert back i miss him

"finally, a pedophile actually worth cancelling #freerohulk"

respect player

I came on some anime prints that you signed

mmmm kraft triple cheese macaroni my first meal in 2 days. back to gaming

this is hilarious

"Wuhan was the aliens‚Äô first landing site, which is why the virus seemed to originate there. magnetic fields around the tibetan plains align with alien‚Äôs tools. this allows the bioweapon to be more easily controlled, china is underreporting cases out of fear for the unknown"

Corona is an extraterrestrial bioweapon and the govt is prohibiting outdoor activity to reduce chances of accidentally happening upon the alien fleet/foot soldiers. recent high density SO2 cluster above Wuhan is the Chinese govt‚Äôs first attempt at ethering an alien camp.

anyone capable of adhering to a schedule as brutal as this is definitionally a sociopath

Every time this man opens his mouth i feel mechanically inferior

i cant believe i‚Äôve been playing minecraft 10 hours a day regularly with a fucking serbian named GooseGodX that uses an XXXTentacion skin

glowstone is the patrician choice of light source

7am the perfect time for nightcore

"Rafis, most known for his hdhr fc on sound of giallarhorn"

i just playde 10 hours of minecraft followed by 6 hours of osu i am the pinnacle of humanity

once again have to commend the people getting these artists on board. LeaF is super super cool

a small part of me really wants this actually to be a chinese bioweapon so that all that all the people getting mad over the phrase ‚Äúchinese virus‚Äù feel really stupid

She said yes

i am a womanizer

polaco about to hit rank 1

chaotic evil

Discord is down? I do not care

so easy

i love my fans

XD

you can't make this shit up. why are these 40-50 year old white women reading this like it's some ancient prophetic text

i spend 300$ a week on uber eats.. i will die shortly

massachusetts shut down restaurants for 3 weeks which sucks because that means i can‚Äôt get my daily ubereats from 5 star restaurants anymore

i have no idea what to quote tweet this with but it deserves to be quote tweeted

"i agree, have you tasted it before"

all of them. they will code future updates as well as set up irl events. they will compose all songs to be mapped. no one else will play the game even. i see no downsides

how about we let the triumvirate of guminis noodleshredder and nalian make all important decisions for the future of the game

will pay 20USD to someone that makes a legacy css

am i the only person who thinks this is just ridiculously stupid and unintuitive

My hidden hardrock play:

david will NOT get the corona virus

"My school was recently shut down for the semester due to the Wuhan Plague because a student tested positive. Turns out he lives 3 houses down from me, and I‚Äôm ecstatic because that means no one will judge me for staying inside indefinitely"

if you close your eyes the corona virus isnt real

going to rebrand as someone ethnic then tweet about how my college should refund me for cancelling due to coronavirus to farm a quick 1-2k followers

notice how very experienced players like matrix/404 ascended to near top tier mappers in the span of only a few months... this is not a coincidence

take: mapping is only ‚Äúhard‚Äù because most mappers have to substitute actual knowledge of the game with brute-force practice in the editor

so true ben

"octopath traveler would be the winner if we‚Äôre only counting ‚Äútraditional‚Äù games, though"

"This will not affect the tweets however, as he never actively posted on here, he merely created the account... We just felt like making a statement here is important.  -the jehlpxyz team"

"with people before, so we just kinda said sure why not). Low and behold he did it again, and now we are dropping him from this account.  I want to apologize for ever forgiving him but he pleaded for forgiveness from us and we really didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd do it again."

"For those of you who don‚Äôt know, the owner of this account was recently called out for flirting with minors. We were aware of this in the past but chose to keep him around because he promised us he would never do it again and said it was only one time (and he was horny-"

"i dont get it. every time someone calls me a virgin/incel on this site i magically get invited to do something irl. back in 2017 when i wasn‚Äôt called either of those regularly, i was WAY more of a shut-in. Maybe if you guys are nicer to me my life will get worse again"

"TL;DR: make slideracc a toggle from the mapper‚Äôs side, make it a mod with 1.00x score multiplier, or if it really comes down to it, do a score wipe (as long as there is an archive)."

"With extremely high HP values, you are incredibly reliant on getting 300s to stay alive, and s.a legitimately makes some maps un-passable. While s.a is typically fine for tournament players, mappools are very curated, and almost all niche things are never played with s.a."

"Lastly we could force all new maps to have s.a, and keep old ones as is (option 3 but the toggle is forced). A lot about this has already been said by other people, but I‚Äôll give my 2 cents on an elephant in the room that most people seem to be ignoring: HP."

"Thirdly, we set it as a toggle from the mapper side. I have nothing to say on this option other than it‚Äôs probably the safest. I don‚Äôt want to say things that have already been said, so check out Charles445‚Äôs video on slider accuracy and its impact on maps"

"If it had a multiplier, you could beat practically any #1 more or less effortlessly (A 97% fc with a 1.02x multiplier will almost always be more score than an SS with 1.00x). So s.a as a mod that buffs PP but not score is also viable."

"There‚Äôs talk about s.a as a mod, and while this seems promising, we have to be careful. If it were a mod (assuming we use the 2nd option), it would have to have a 1.00x score multiplier (same as nomod)."

"there is no scenario where someone beats toy‚Äôs score with s.a. Or even   which has 0circles, 779sliders, ar9 od10. Most FCs on this are SS, and with s.a an SS would be near impossible due to ar/od. Basically this makes competition dead on any existing map."

"Second, we just submit s.a scores on the same leaderboard of existing scores. This is the most idiotic of the three options. This basically means a lot of scores become practically untouchable. Consider some stupid acc map like harmless minor"

"It would probably be tons of fun while the boards are empty (1-2 years), but once the boards get saturated again, we‚Äôll just be sad we don‚Äôt have the old scores. So I think in the long run this is pretty silly."

"Therefore we have four options for s.a. First, a score wipe. We archive all the scores and reset every leaderboard. Despite being a score player myself, I actually am fine with this idea as every map would become a free-for-all."

"As a result, if we implement s.a, we can‚Äôt properly recalculate any score that doesn‚Äôt have an available replay. Because we can‚Äôt recalc most scores, we can‚Äôt recalc any (for consistency reasons)."

"Consider this replay-less score: we have no idea where the 318x combo was, it could‚Äôve been at the start, end, or somewhere in the middle. Likewise we have no idea where he got the 100s/50/miss. Going even further, we have no idea how late or early he hit each 300."

"to understand the effects of s.a, you need to understand what a score rebalance entails. we only store the top 1k replays on a map, so we can't do any changes to score. This is because the data associated with a score is: scorev1 score, mods, 300/100/50/miss count, acc and combo"

i think i'm the way i am because i can joke about serial rapists with my dad and not feel uncomfortable

dont give him wiggle room to fuck over the game. sometimes using ethos in an aggressive manner is imperative

i think the main reason ppy doesnt regard the opinions of the masses is bc he just assumes the people telling him what to do are all kids. i‚Äôd like to see how he would react if people like toy/happystick/azer/gn/karthy etc unified on issues and pressed him hard

we should make wing my way the record just to fuck with everyone

"If you spin a coin on its side, it gives off the illusion of roundness! Apply this metaphor to our disc-shaped Earth. This should clear up many misconceptions!"

"I don't know of anyone that has actually visited Antarctica, and for good reason. It's not a singular place, but rather a term for the border of our disk-shaped planet (and it is guarded by NASA)"

To all that see me as an inspiration: Thank you!

Don't you mean all around the disc? Yes we do!

"Logically, it would make much more sense to FAKE a space program than to have one for monetary reasons. Hopefully you understand this argument and join the army of flat earthers, in hopes of overthrowing NASA and revealing the earth‚Äôs true nature. (6/6)"

"Photos of the globe are clearly fake, GPS devices are rigged to make pilots think they are flying in a straight line, but rather they are flying in circles above the disc. Why the government hides the secret of the world from us is unknown, but likely for financial reasons. (5/6)"

"Objects do NOT accelerate downward, but rather the disc we live on accelerates UPWARD at a rate of 32 feet/second. This is caused by a mysterious force we know as ‚Äúdark energy‚Äù.  (4/6)"

"The stars move in a plane roughly 3000 miles above the earth. To account for lunar eclipses, there exists a so called ‚Äúanti-moon‚Äù composed of antimatter, that obfuscates the sun‚Äôs light. Next I will discuss the illusion of gravity. (3/6)"

Antarctica is a 150-foot-fall wall of ice around the rim. NASA guards this wall to prevent people from climbing over and falling off the disc. The day and night cycle is explained by the fact that the sun and moon are spheres that orbit above the plane of the Earth. (2/6)

"Hello, I will be providing a thread to explain why the spherical representation of the earth is, in fact, a fallacy. In this thread I will reveal the true nature of the earth. The earth is in fact a disc with the arctic circle at its center. (1/6)"

Just ate some colorful drawing utensils I got the crayola virus

"it should go without saying but i treat twitter pretty much like a stream of consciousness, and as a human being i am allowed to have ‚Äúwrong‚Äù thoughts and ‚Äúbad‚Äù opinions. idc if people call me out because it just shows i‚Äôm a real person. silly that i feel the need to say this tho"

"sometimes i wish my most of my followers didn‚Äôt know what i looked like, for two reasons: 1) my facial charm must be insanely intimidating, and 2) I would be way more mysterious"

this is why i'm in mensa

"Creating two VERIFIED roles in my discord server but one is spelled VERIF'L'ED with a lowercase L so you can't tell the difference. The plan is to invite as many e-girls as i can, and lock them in a fake #general chat (using the fake role) while my friends and I watch from safety"

the fact that the chinese walled in 35 million people leads me to believe that the corona virus is a bit more serious than the media is making it out to be

Making moves in the twitter world

2600 people definitely know one (me) (i am in mensa)

i dont trust anyone that uses custom fonts for twitter

it‚Äôs a shame that the hottest art style in the world is representative of the single cringiest form of media

This tweet is a social experiment

"im feeling so ridiculously festive right now, you guys have no idea. merry christmas, friends!"

why isn‚Äôt there a social media where only based people are allowed to join

just opened up facebook for the first time in a while and realized i hate more people there than i do here

On christmas I will remember that only black people and anime avatars can fearlessly use the N word

"Aside the fact that this is ridiculously lame, how did it take Twitter Support this long to notice? Like actually what are these people being paid to do"

nothing gets past me @minusGN

can we please address this it's honestly giving me anxiety

im just tilted because my mutuals keep getting suspended for such bullshit reasons

maybe if you guys avoided keywords you wouldn‚Äôt get suspended every week

would you all believe me if i told you i positively contribute to society

STOP PROJECTING

if u think the best japanese vocalist is anyone other than kotoko or katakiri rekka you‚Äôre a zoomer

is that why i can‚Äôt find an e-girlfriend

i did it

relationship goals...

i had so much potential and yet i ended up on twitter

I don‚Äôt activate windows because there is simply no need. thanks for noticing

#USAWin lets goooo I'm expecting a 7-0 victory GL everyone

i cant believe we collectively just cyberbullied a low follower account into deleting like 20 tweets. lets gooooooooooooooo

What would I possibly do without twitter topics

"i‚Äôll make it authentic too. in order to receive my inheritance, on the last level you‚Äôll have to remote view my corpse"

"when i die, i will leave my will sealed behind 140 levels of notpron-inspired riddles"

"Hey @AmericanMensa how does it feel that I, an ephebophile, am one of u"

yet to find an account with their name surrounded by„Äå„Äçthat i take seriously

"I‚Äôm quitting the internet. I have a girlfriend now, there is no longer a need for me to derive happiness from people I have never met before. Goodbye"

i have so many genius @ ideas but i dont want to lose my twitter handle virginity

i havent seen a scorepost in a few hours. did my tweet scare them away

im toxic

did everyone just conveniently forget hunter x hunter is a shounen from this decade

toushi is basically one of the replyguys we all make fun of except he has followers

I hate it when my fake cutting board acts superior to my fake rolling pin

i used to like animemes like 2 years ago but now it‚Äôs basically /r/transrights which is not the content i want to see

im more inclined to appreciate a scorepost captioned something like ‚Äúnice‚Äù or ‚Äúreally happy with this‚Äù much more than ‚ÄúFUJFJFKFKGJRJJ457PP‚Äù or ‚ÄúWHAT IS THIS SCORE?????‚Äù. Food for thought

official steam release is tomorrow but this makes me so sad üò≠ hopefully a fan patch is made quickly

Whoever mass produces a portable foam cushion that you can place on one of these to restore the 13 degrees will undoubtedly become a multimillionaire

"we‚Äôve truly entered the dark ages, beasttroll is top100 ranked score"

i dont use deodorant i use warheads spray candy

did a constellation give you this opinion or did you come up with it on your own

twitter is so insane i can just tell all my followers i hate them on a regular basis and i somehow get more

"i‚Äôve never changed my discord name or tag in all 4 years of having an account, loyalty like mine is hard to come by(my dms are open gn)"

I want to rt things but only like 5 of u tweet things worth rting

My timeline has been purged of all evils. Now I can enjoy this app in peace

No matter how unemployed I may be I will never become a video game journalist

I can really see the emphasis in your statement from how you purposely misspelled ‚Äúfuckign‚Äù

This tweet is a social experiment

The next have some sip of cola tweet gets the guillotine

Keep replying cowards. I do not notice

I have so many of you guys muted you have no idea hahaha

I haven‚Äôt seen a gym in 9 years

no one nominated for best twitter user of 2019 is a pedophile this is obvious bias

"Ok, riddle me this:"

"Probably the most solid tweet I've seen from a boomer checkmark account in a long time, I'm personally not looking forward to the Netflix adaptation of Genesis where Cain and Abel do oral"

"POV: I, A ChessGrandmaster, challenge you, a BetaMale, to chess pawn e4"

"USA is very strong, but picture this: Habib swapped out for Abdul"

FA request: waterflame

this is revenge for our harsh treatment during colonization @UnitedKingdom

I‚Äôm a chess grandmaster

any of my female followers interested in joining me as I prepare for world conquest

this is easily my favorite new addition in lazer

"My drive to be successful comes entirely from my dream of owning a checkmark account, so I can start twitter beef with myself between anonymous and public personas"

Are the alt-right just conservatives that alternate

James getting unrestricted and then immediately getting a twitter suspension is proof that the universe is always trying to maintain an equilibrium

"Any true Woey fan would know that he is an android user, but all of his most recent tweets are sent from an iPhone... much to think about"

This guy has never even SEEN an anime...

use your words neanderthals

all the people ambiguously spamming question marks clearly directed at the #GameAwards2019 right now could be lined up and shot and i wouldn‚Äôt feel anything

don‚Äôt mess with me I‚Äôm super strong and I can run really fast

If you order mild rather than spicy chicken at Popeyes you are a weakling and a coward

"for those of you that don't know, tied scores are sorted chronologically in leaderboards, but in game they are sorted alphabetically (if you look at the leaderboard on the side while playing)"

this is actually my best tweet ever

I am the Andrew Yin to Mismagius‚Äô Andrew Yang

This trend is insanely technological thanks twitter

"i am fully convinced that FGSky can scorepost anything and as long as it‚Äôs 4mod, it will get hundreds of likes"

"so many players nowadays are so absorbed in their own consistency that if they don't do something in &lt;5 tries, it's deemed impossible. the art of the grind is slowly becoming a lost skill"

this is especially funny to me because neither of us followed each other in the first place

good night everyone except people that don't follow me ‚ú®

All I do is provide endless entertainment for you guys. What do I get in return? You take my #1s and call me a l*ser. Talk about equivalent exchange...

"Every two seconds someone is messaging me the equivalent of 'LOOOL you got blasted by Pokimane!!'. I do not care. Do you really think I made the tweet(s) thinking the outcome would be that I actually date her? Are you daft? Twitter is a battle, and I am emerging victorious."

I never would have thought that kyaandere would try to leech clout off of one of my tweets I really am peaking

pokimane replying to toy's tweet is further proof we live in a simulation

im trying to think of a tweet solely to irritate bd but im really struggling

im so glad a hashinshin-esque video of me cumming next to anime art that pokimane signed doesn't exist and isn't leaked

if someone good at osu tweeted like me they would have 10k follows easily

last pokemon tweet but anyone that thinks sword and shield is a fun game that the developers put a lot of thought into can be instantly refuted with this image

"the reason so many games from the early 2000s are still speedrun is that no matter the game, it was designed to challenge the player in some capacity (and thereby player A can be better than player B). what is it with new E/E10 rated games being possible for infants to complete"

ok i beat it that game was dogshit

I cant believe Hebel threw the Mexico vs Chile match. He fucked my pickem's so badly. We should all send him d**th thr**ts and d*x him.

The equivalent of rock bottom in the pokemon universe is being one of the trainers in the gym that isn't the gym leader. what is the career path that leads to this

I've never wanted to physically be inside a game more than Pokemon Sword/Shield just so I can bully the crap out of my rival. Let me play for 30 minutes without interrupting me in some bullshit way CHRIST this annoying fucker deserves to be trapped inside a gym locker

i just beat the living shit out of nessa #PokemonSwordandShield

throwback to when xiaoxiao osu was a thing and she blocked me on twitter cuz i had her dox

"emerald sword happened just yesterday and frankly is more demanding in practically all aspects of gameplay, but due to the lack of community-wide anticipation behind the score, it fell a bit flat in terms of recognition. nothing we can do about this, but awareness is key"

"masterpiece is a great score, but the fact it's getting blindly praised as the pinnacle of old map ability (due to its history with c) exemplifies the fact that only an extremely small subset of players are able to differentiate between the difficulty of comparable maps"

The joke is that this play is doubletapped. Laugh with me.

do u ever just get to the end of a game that has no end? yeah this is the end. its all over. osu is over. pack it up. i won.

True fact my childhood dog was named Marnie so whenever i see anything sword/shield related my mind immediately thinks about beastiality

people that pronounce aesthetic as aestetic are subhuman

How do you retweet 300+k things and only create 21 original tweets this feels like i took the red pill

this account has 318k tweets and all of them but 21 are RTs loooooooool

i felt really blackpilled tonight so i farmed

real or fake

"why does everyone subscribe to this 'roll dubs' idiocy. i prefer actual high stakes, such as roll evens or roll odds"

nothing intimidates me more than when i browse suburban mom twitter and i see an account with a name formatted like ùë∫ùñôùñäùñïùñçùñÜùñìùñéùñä

"i have not physically laughed out loud reading a comment in a long time (source, hailie's new map)"

doing some insane fetish analysis with james right now

neoliberalism has led us to view our relationships are transactional... due to a concept created by anthropologists... ah yes of course. no one on twitter is doing that analysis WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE

this is legit the most effort ive had to put into parsing a tweet in so long

i bet this only has a 22% rating on google books because only 22% of people could understand the book

nothing sounds more like rock bottom than being a call of duty data miner

why do i bother using this app still im too OLD

go on

tweeting from 3-5am sucks because no one is awake to give me validation

"i keep seeing the lucas instagram post on my timeline so i checked this out of curiosity, my trigger finger is itching"

James' new schizophrenic twitter account is scary

how are these people REAL and how do other people willingly like these comments ohm ygod

THE COMMENT SECTION

NVM I found one from 2016 and holy shit it's beast

i haven't seen a good christian rock naruto AMV in at least 5 years and that's really reflected in society

"dislike the common normie argument that 'gaming is primarily a form of escapism'. games by definition are supposed to be fun and/or competitive, so why is it so hard to understand that people play because it's what they want to do, not because they have nothing better to do"

took a 5 hour nap gm say it back

Just added ryuk on osu. I hope he adds me back owo

nothing more beast than Miki Sayaka vs. Miki Sayaka (fw. Miki Sayaka)

this is what mental illness looks like

unfollowed someone on here and they blocked me LMAO. good riddance

gm everyone except the people playing sword and shield

"i never would have expected where osu would take me when i first started. i have experienced so many great things. I have multiple pedophile mutuals, I know of a guy that doesn‚Äôt own shoes, and I learned how to speedcube. What more could I ask for from a game?"

reading through posts in my university‚Äôs facebook group and at least half are about sex. why do these people crave an act so primitive when instead they could shut themselves indoors for days at a time like me

it‚Äôs been over 24 hours since i launched my patreon and i don‚Äôt have a single patron. I even copy and pasted belle delphine‚Äôs bio exactly and i still have nothing. this is further proof that the most marginalized group is the cis white male

been using this app for four years and just learned there‚Äôs a like limit of 17000 likes per day. has anyone ever even hit this unintentionally

how do people make friends through twitter

weird to think about that the high point of 10% of my following‚Äôs day is their gacha pulls

does this game make you bland or is it just that bland people play this game

I can't believe whitecat still breastfeeds

opens twitter sees scorepost refresh sees another scorepost refresh  sees politics refresh blue dragon tweet refresh sees yet another scorepost closes twitter

Just finished watching Aireus Raspberry: A Ball and a Dream (The Documentary). Fantastic tale of improvement about my friend  @Aireuu üëç

Anyone with closed dms is seriously missing out

i cant believe fatlover69 went private on twitter

cookiezi made the right move

If mightydoc changed his name to Abduwul he would be a way cuter player

What if eminem picked up osu and got #1 on rap god

Dms: Open

Thinking about accepting

does anyone have the hooker video that got nuked from the sub i wanna rewatch it

is it possible to become a gymcel without actually going to the gym

I feel like james was sammyclassicsonicfan but no one ever found out

"Day 2 of being a scientologist. I have donated enough to delve into the inner circles of this religion and I am learning some of their darker secrets, such as David Miscavige (chairman of scientology) being a shotacon."

it's really humbling to think that there were things cookiezi did in 2010 that i can't match at all

I'm still baffled that I got approved as a patreon creator

Thank you all for 2000 followers!!! As the most influential person in your life I have decided to open a patreon so you can all support my endeavors further. I love every last one of you!!!!

i swear every week i see a tweet from someone that just finished danganronpa acting like they're orpheus returning from the deepest depths of Japanese Media

James

If league of legends existed in the 1970s ice t would be challenger

will only take you 30 seconds please pokimane

"How long will I be trapped in this purgatory of mid 1990 followers, I've been fluctuating around here for like 3 days and it's killing my mental ..."

As a newly converted scientologist i feel closer and closer to Tom Cruise each second. I think I'm only about three donations away from starring in Top Gun myself

this would be the best osu content to happen in a long time can we make it happen...

Genius idea: Are you smarter than a 5th grader RyuK vs Spare vs BeasttrollMC

"however i do feel a bit of cognitive dissonance between your public persona and who you really are: a level-headed, passionate, reserved guy with a great dark sense of humor. now that you‚Äôre 22 i hope you can begin to bridge that gap and show more people the real Toy  cheers dude"

"HAPPY BIRTHDAY @ToybickIer ! i know a lot of compliments you get don‚Äôt leave much of an impact on you anymore because of your position in the community, but I do really think you‚Äôre one of the most incredible people i know. (1/2)"

I will edate anyone that correctly guesses which one i do not have

hollow knight is so good i'm mad at myself for avoiding it two years ago

i enjoy the game

I cant believe the backstreet boys are an FA this is insane

happystick hasn't tweeted in a week. he must be gaming

"probably one of my best scores despite the last note miss, nerves broke me at the end"

its really awful when the hard part of an aim map is perfect stacks and not the aim itself

Doubletap

James please wake up

Seething with anger

Pisses me off when i'm awake at 5am and i'm forced to talk to foreign friends because no one is up.

what the . fuck is going ON

i dont know the context of this but this is easily the most erudite collection of men #osu has ever seen

it's always so uncomfortable you're having a nice one-on-one conversation in a #spectator chat and then some random dude with a name equivalent to 'TacoLord7116' spontaneously appears with the sole purpose of spamming F

i settled with gusgh829/legendre

.@fgskyyy is timewarping in paper mario

Suggest names for link/epona here

New game has been decided

"ok just finished my revisit to super paper mario and was lots of fun &gt;___&lt; (total playtime: 10h, 58min)  4 deaths total on levels: 3-3, 5-3, 6-1, 8-3  chapters i had fun with from most to least: 8,5,7,3,1,4,2,6  now i need another nintendo game to do"

Please not lucas

mismagius is a neural net

our generation is doomed

tiomw (that insane osu moment when) every hddt on the map is 99.6 or higher and u fc with 93 #insaneosumoments

i just fced chika shirtless

James

after exerting extreme amounts of brainpower the closest thing i can think of is some boomer fishing account with an avatar like this

what is the opposite of a deku avatar

oh my GOD toy i love u

Female speed players don't exist because if they fingered themselves they would die

"on top of this, if osu! magically does get 'hit', the chinese kid can just play offline and submit his scores during his 7.5 hours of 'online time', something that is completely impossible for almost any other game"

"for the lazy: china is letting minors play online games for 7.5h/week MAXIMUM, however the only games that can be monitored are actual 'companies'  it's likely osu! will be exempt from this as osu! is intrinsically singleplayer-- score submission cannot be firewalled easily"

can‚Äôt wait for the extreme rise in chinese osu! players

YOO @vaxeiosu

FIRST DEATH ON 3-3 IM SO BAD gjfkdls

Continuing paper mario journey soon

ppl act like my tweets exist to spark Genuine Discussion when this app is just a way for me to astral project my consciousness directly into retarded amalgamations of words and nothing more

cookiezi fced made of fire and ppl are seriously stanning whitecat like hes fucking jungkook

Insane stream everyone thank u for the insane turnout We beat chapters 1 and 2 .  I will be back in 5 hours with more insane Jay Let's Plays  of paper mario . We are beginning the FRANCIS chapter where there are anime references. See u all later tonight.

insane how all the people annoyed that i didn't specify sardoche rather than the offical game_osu channel are french

GAME OSU CHAT

Watching Bernie Sanders' Just Chatting stream on twitch and he just FCed the 1 percent

no hate to jaye at all because i love seeing players do shit like this but my point is that if cookiezi isn‚Äôt deserving of a title then no one is

"i have fced twice the amount of std maps where‚Äôs my title  jokes aside this is a cool achievement, but why does this guy get a title instead of i dont know like COOKIEZI who has pushed the boundaries of osu! for almost a decade"

Just putting it here that the first ever scores i did as jehlp again are SSes on every diff of a system of a down map

KING IS BACK (previously known as bakabaka answer)

I can't believe Vaxei is 49% better than Chocomint

I haven‚Äôt cringed this hard since i saw Fred: The Movie in 2010

my grandma who is barely capable of using a phone just texted me feminist propaganda

At 2000 followers I will open a patreon

Dude @MismagiusBD no way

Currently out to eat and I see two men at the table adjacent to me. One says ‚ÄúVibe check‚Äù and the other replies with ‚ÄúBruh‚Äù. The first man says ‚ÄúVibe check‚Äù again. Every subsequent bite I take has less and less taste as the two of them keep talking. I start having a panic attack

Deleted the tweet so eph u can go back to playing final fantasy now nothing is wrong

shoutout to the dude who twitter dm‚Äôd me a picture of his thigh and said because he was a cute eboy i should give him osu mutualüëç

Profile undergoing renovation #NewProfilePic

"like this isn‚Äôt a one time thing, there was the TTYD security guard collab a few years back... like of ALL the nintendo releases, why do they keep coming back to the paper mario franchise??"

i am eternally fascinated by the USA owc members‚Äô fascination with paper mario avatar collabs when to my knowledge not many of them have actually played the games

I‚Äôm 20 and i can‚Äôt fc freedom dive HDHR with 99.83%

one of my housemates started seriously getting into anime and he watches everything with no headphones and on a ridiculously loud volume  i love going downstairs to heat up some pizza and hear Mrs Green Apple instead

wish i had more non-osu twitter friends/mutuals üòï

foot is asleep. waking him up

whenever i see accounts that follow 1000+ people i get seriously intimidated because i know that person does not give a fuck about what appears on their TL

this tweet didn‚Äôt age well

pepega spec

yo @shigetora_twit bakabaka answer here can u fc yuyu metal next time u play thanks

subscribe to the list

i wish azer would hitsound me

all the people that think random=funny think my tierlist sucks haha stay mad

i didn't put myself in the list cuz i cant judge myself so idk where i'd go

OSU twitter user tierlist (objective)

but actually though if said osu twitter tier list existed who would be SS tier  my contenders would be like BD and firedigger

there should be an osu twitter user tier list where i am at the top and all of the UK and France is at the bottom

holy fucking brazil leaderboard LOL

Aireu

words cannot describe how happy i am for aireu

social experiment

kyaandere's thighs

i must be hallucinating

ZETSUBOU RESTAURANT TECH MAP

there hasn't been an anime in the past 2 years that has genuinely impressed me idk how people still spam all the seasonals

Thanks twitter but you don‚Äôt need to notify me when i like something 10 hours ago

(Part one)

me when adam dms me

"RIP brother, may you get SS in the next life."

i accidentally just put my phone in the microwave for a few seconds

Holy shit. I am the first 4 mod pass and it is an SS. This is insane!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"will never understand usernames with trailing numbers on services that allow non-unique naming (steam, discord, etc...)"

what the hell did this bot do for its first 1800 tweets there are only like 200 countries total

osu players start tweeting in japanese and justify it with their 3 japanese followers

‡ºº;¬¥‡ºé‡∫∂ €ù ‡ºé‡∫∂‡ºΩ

ok i hate discord custom statuses now

TIL im #1 usa on about 2% of all ranked maps.. thats a pretty damn high number if you ask me

u know orange and black are traditionally both the colors of halloween right

can‚Äôt believe i replenished her magical energy with sex

my uber eats driver deadass named ‚ÄòGerman‚Äô thats so beast

score is nice i guess but holy shit scorev1 moments

NOT!!!!!

Damn. I guess I have to give him mutual now.

"You really think you're mightydoc haha you have nothing on him. Abdul's keyboard spam perfectly integrates capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, expletives and symbols. This is like a doodle being compared to picasso. Also ur blatantly cheating lol"

the new discord custom statuses are fantastic

actually i retract this statement because if u guys didn't rank so much dogshit i wouldn't appreciate the good stuff nearly as much

ALSO defending urself by saying Oh I Map J-Rock is actually even more virgin than falling in the above category Tea

alll these virgin mappers mapping le insane anime and le awesome idols oh my GODD go outside and get a lifee

Guys I did it!!!!!! PP Rain!!!!!!!!!!

correct opinion: gatekeeping is actually healthy because it protects things from being polluted by people not willing to put in effort to learn about the subject of said gatekeeping

Going to farm youtube comment likes by posting ‚ÄúWho is here from OSU!!!‚Äù under every video of every song that has ever been mapped

"thought i'd start using a personal account for thoughts that are more about my irl life @jw_irl   used this account as an echo chamber about a year ago when i wasn't in a good place mentally, but i just nuked it and now it'll be for non-osu things  mutuals feel free to follow"

everyone james is appealing live on twitch!!!

pokimane fan

like I just tabbed into his stream and THIS is the first message I see  sniperkitten69: @ WubWoofWolf i mapped a 7* big black and i cant pass it i am a 6 digit do you want to check it out?

insane how wubwoofwolf stream chat attracts the people who know the least about osu yet his stream is maybe one of the few that u need ridiculous knowledge of the game to actually appreciate

made of fire is a really good play but have you seen mightydoc #1s

yoo @lesleyvanhoek cookiezi fced ur map

enjoying life

dude morgan i am so angry you are free

oh you like osu? name every map in it

Dude @Aireuu This guy is insane

i had a dream last night where i checked james‚Äô twitter account and he had 1.7 million followers

this is the worst breed of twitter account

i bet i could down a pint of raspberry lemonade faster than cookiezi

insane

Who is this ‚ÄúAireu‚Äù guy with #1 on worldwide choppers? Didn‚Äôt lain used to have #1 there? What happened to him

putting this here too

dude @WholeWheatPete no way

"unironically very interested if people actually gave a shit how many of these could be done, will upload the full list in about half an hour"

getting every sub 5 star map without an hddt fc RN.

why dont  i have 10k followers yet

"if osu was a tv series, adamqs would be a minor reoccurring background character that the theory crafting hyper fans are convinced will eventually pay off even though he does not"

"everyone posting their friendslist but for me i don't see the need, if i talk to you most likely i have you added  but  dream mutuals:  Dsan cr1m Sinch  please add me"

i challenge u to a gaming competition @Ninja

rafis is the only real top player because he is top both inside and outside the game

does anyone have a fate download link i kind of want to read it

"‚ÄúIf world against the Astar , I am against the world‚Äù is one of the most profound lines over all literature"

"You forgot ""Osu"""

cant believe dean responds to james' racist tweets but leaves me on read when i bring up an actual concern

can someone actually explain to me why happy halloween won like literally everything

GN the only levelheaded human as usual

undescribable soychamp energy from twitch chat when they count to 85 when the 85 combo comes on the screen

yo @vinxis1 where is the mca Enjoyable Map To Play category

bikko's ss on fanzhen helix is the stonehenge of osu

"it. just dismember him on sight. it's what he deserves.   ok best of luck woey, you got this! woey owc 2020!"

"azur lane and delete it, all of it. this might take a while, but the lack of azur lane will make jehlp end his own life so technically you'd have clean hands in this scenario, as long as you're willing to go to coding school for about 6 years.   5. just fucking kill him. just end"

"for being ""sweet"". you, as his former lover, could probably pull this off as an attempt to regain his affection.   3. spike his la croix. we all know jay is probably a dirty fu cking la croix drinker, shit is poison anyways. just amp up the wattage on that shit.   4. hack into"

"can't possibly convince jay to quit. we can't destroy his peripherals, as he could surely regain them in time. that's why, in this essay, i will be giving you the top 5 ways to kill jehlp.   1. send water over the internet. make sure it is sent from a connection on ethernet, to a"

"scores, his taunting nature has bogged you down for too long. if jehlp was eliminated, you would surely see more #1s, and not just on leaderboards, you would be rank #1. you would have money, fame, women, anything you could ask for. but now you ask, how do you overcome this? we"

"ok woey. i've been a long time viewer and big fan, and i've noticed ONE thing getting in your way; some people would say, is it www scores? maybe your buggy client? perhaps the jump aim is your biggest crux. however, i've found the REAL hinderance: bakabaka answer. this guy, his"

looking at my friendslist rn and feeling sad about the missing name between abyssal and aden

english songs good

ok this might win as my favorite old map source

"i know its been almost a year now but why was age removed from userpages @ppy, i liked seeing that"

i sent cookiezi a kalibe map to try

yo @Skillosu delete them

THE MOON

ppl are seriously watching league of legends when cookiezi is just DTing everything in the game (he just fced luv letter)

"even though the giant anime girl on my skin's spinner element prevents me from reading absolutely anything behind the spinner, i still use it  is this the osu version of being blue pilled"

can't hear u over all the arguments i have won

are there any other search terms that are on par with this that aren't in that old imgur album

TIL searching 'kys yoshi loved emo dom anime girl scat dearly' gives u a ranked map

nice

just got out of the shower

insane this actually works

reading danganronpa is trash in 2019 cuz everyone has spoiled it for everyone else already go read real vns

bottom check: @ ing someone and starting ur message with ‚Äòsorry for the ping‚Äô

ive been exclusively using apple computers for 9 years and people still think clowning me for using an objectively better os is still gonna sting

rewatched laputa castle in the sky and it‚Äôs still the best anime movie of all time

"decent acc/sliderend score, surprised this only has 500 submitted scores in 2 years tho"

it‚Äôs called yuri you wouldn‚Äôt understand

adamqs leaderboard withdrawal really hitting tn sucks the coolest play in the game (mayday b 3mod) will never be known about

nope everyone else just has bad taste

Osu player spotlight ‚úçÔ∏è: Denaxik

poor Denaxik does unhinged scores every single day but nobody seems to give a shit since they're all busy circlejerking over whitecat or other scores on the same 50 maps that give a big pp number    Give this man some love

Why do people call these reading maps if i can sightread both. Discuss

Azur lane

Speed is a useless skill when you can just doubletap

secret to avoiding osu drama (worked 5 years so far for me) is only befriend cis white males

they're also fat

!!

"at least people actually give bartek attention, gfmrt is doing unmatchable shit on like every modern map and no one notices whatsoever, give him love too"

current state of osu is where hd is easier to read than nomod

avatar of a hidden player

Fucking hidden players

He's right we should just not play hidden it's too overweighted

it doesn't take extra effort to learn hidden if you put the effort into learning it every time you play

i swear every day i see some sort of anti-hidden propaganda like lol sorry we are better than you at the game no need to be insecure

I just saw joker and i vibed and drained the whole time

got over a year+ long mindblock on this chinese map by doing this during the break

Dude @djadamqs you really didn't have to do all this for me thanks a bunch

Osu is a fun game but not really sure why peppy invented a game thats harder to play in the cold

my favorite part of azur lane is when i get notifications that begin with nyaa

i think i have at least a 70% chance of success

"unsure about the rest of the family but the main kid is only verbally committed to osu, i‚Äôve been living it for years"

i wouldnt be azur lane master if i wasn‚Äôt

Adamqs may have died but osu!install(8).exe still lives on

dude @MismagiusBD check this out

Gone for good they say? Adamqs is never ‚Äúgone‚Äù.

Article 12 Directive 95/46/EC of the European Union is not enough to shackle Adamqs to the ground. He is immortal. He will rise from the ashes like the phoenix. Mark my words

Adamqs will return.

making my own language who wants to learn it first

you cant make this shit up

currently downloading AI: The Somnium Files and i cant wait to spam the shit out of this

peppy uve been around for 12 years so how about u set a 100pp play before judging another player‚Äôs skill

&gt;legit or not this is one of the more braindead thought processes i‚Äôve seen staff have in a while

Look i know we just unbanned u two days ago but we didnt actually realize u were really good so even though you‚Äôre 15 years old if u dont go to a specified location and replicate 900pp plays on a foreign setup we will ban u again

"it feels really weird to see a player of WhiteCat's caliber at only #37 - it gives a massive sense of how far the game has progressed in the three entire years it's been since he was last playing. however, WhiteCat is clearly one of the best players in the game despite his rank,"

really interesting lecture today

Whitecat getting pp gave me depression

"I made this puzzle rather quickly, I would have organized it slightly differently in retrospect. the colors of the text in the fourth image match the combo colors of the solution map as a sort of bonus hint, but I think this definitely would have been better w/o that red herring."

"Now we have ‚ÄòSpirit‚Äô, ‚ÄòPast‚Äô, and the location ‚ÄòSource‚Äô. And now the rest should be easy. The only map with spirit and past in the source is the solution   !"

"+Between both maps, the only features that could be worth grabbing that are similar are the diffnames.I would be unreasonable for me to think you should grab a tag from one map or a pattern from another maps.Realizing the clues are are about diffnames make this puzzle consistent."

"In retrospect I regret choosing a pattern that could be interpreted as grid/distance snap, but when realizing there are only two maps in osu with the diffname [past], and the other is a 2013 easy diff, it should be clear I just wanted the diffname."

"Lastly lets look at the 3rd image. Most people heavily overthought this. This was the only image where instead of showing a background, I showed an image inside the editor. This map was Six Trillion Years and Overnight Story [Past]."

"This map has literally NOTHING notable.. no diff name, barely any tags, and only two really ambiguous pictures in the description. The only information worth grabbing is the diff name, spirit."

"Now we have Alfarshear Black sheep.. this should really hint at a sentence type format. When you shear sheep, you get wool. This is an osu puzzle, so lets search for maps with the word ‚Äòwool‚Äô as a keyword. Only one exists (   ) !"

"when searching by Artist, mode=o, status=r (ranked standard maps), if you ‚Äò-1‚Äô from your current selection, you get to the map Sonata Arctica - Black Sheep, once again something a few people solved."

"Now lets go in order. The first image is from the map Alfarshear, and there isn‚Äôt really anything else to say in that image. The second image is from the map Song Riders - Be, with what seems to be a beatmap search above it. Implying a song library of all ranked maps,"

"so the similarity is between the sets as a whole. If you look at the beatmap pages, all of them have incorrect source metadata; all are just listed as ‚ÄúTouhou‚Äù instead of something proper, like Êù±ÊñπÈ¢®Á•ûÈå≤„ÄÄÔΩû Mountain of Faith, so WHERE they are similar is at the source."

"However I said WHERE are they similar, NOT what is similar between these, implying the ‚Äòanswer‚Äô to the 4th clue is a location. All the mapsets in the image are not single-difficulty sets, so it would be stupid to imply a similarity between arbitrary difficulties of different sets"

"Im going to start with the 4th image. The key here the fact that I put text here AT ALL. If I just put 4 overlapping backgrounds in one image, it would be implied to look for a similarity."

okay its been long enough.. time to post solution and piss everyone off (thread)

can anyone help me aireu and dada with something image-editing related? we need to remove all pixels of a certain color from an image and none of has any advanced image editing software

cursed boomer images is on a fourth of july field day rn i love it

cannot believe osu! is actually listed as a PVP game in the discord store

genuine question: why do people sub to twitch streamers  you arent supporting them as much as directly donating and it also costs a shit ton/month if you‚Äôre subbed to multiple people- a few emotes is nowhere near worth it IMO

the true meaning of my username

"im so excited for this 50 diff set to get ranked (  and everyone to be like 'i gotta try the new 50 diff mapset', play 30 seconds of the top diff and quit once they realize its not farm and ignore the other 49 diffs forever"

"so i just fced a random 5 star map, my health went to 0 after hitting the last object and now im just stuck inside the map after the mp3 ended with no way to end the map other than to quit out  Things You Didn't Even Know Could Happen In Osu"

im usually not one to talk about upvote distribution but this is beast as fuck

burnt out of both minecraft and osu so now i need something new to spam   what do i play/watch...

Very relaxing day today

just choked an fc cuz silvar sent me a snapchat and the vibration of my phone on my leg startled me

ppl who deliberately choose the color of the heart emoji every time they type it intimidate me

A bit late but heres my take on the top 50.

"just ate french bread pizza and came back and fixed the lag, 64 of each mystical flower obtained so botania spam time maybe"

"just spent 2 hours loading chunks looking for a questing ram and now my game runs at 5fps, guess its time to pay for server hosting singleplayer"

know my power

very weird rng on ardite cobalt hunt

chippy themed ender tank

"why does steel take 47829482927493 years in the standard blast furnace.?.,?.,.,"

i named my horse adamqs cuz it takes up a lot of space and never reached top 10 in osu

t3 made pepega

road to resonant

my polymath aura is especially strong today

"plans to start tomorrow: crafting terminal, t2 jetpack, build stable/tame horse, kill ender dragon, begin twilight forest progression (hopefully up to hydra), ardite/cobalt/manulynn full set, reactor  after this is 30 hours of botania very cool very nice i like it"

nvm not enough mental stamina at 4am just gonna farm blaze rods then sleep

jfc ok i got all the presses time to commit self harm and make storage chips

accidentally found end portal when looking for the last two presses nice

meteor hunt time haha

jetback obtained later than id hoped cuz too distracted on quests/achievement farming for 100%

early game fucking blows man i just want to get a t3 jetpack already

vaxei rlly good at osu but have you seen his credit score

FOUND IT

ok vaxei gonna dt senketsu before 2020 if he doesnt quit

charged certus literally doesnt exist

minecraft ftb 100% run starts now see you in 200 hours

what the hell

what with the mapping trend of every map having a stupid boring intro just to lead up into an unfun hard part

2019 and theres no ranked set of grief and malice

i am humbled beyond words @JamesCageWhite

people whine about how alting is cheating but singletap scores on alt maps are equally cheated and you wont change my mind

why is there no aegislash in pokemon sword and shield he literally is a fucking sword and shield

someone make an ftb infinity evolved server i need something to do

cant break the 7 star barrier

haha you play on mac comments here

o nice i just updated to the newest version of cutting edge and my client is locked from opening right as i was doing cool ar6 stuff bye guys was fun

"ok fuck ding this is 1xsb 1miss then 5 miss in one pattern in the last 50x, the fact this is doable/chokable is awesome"

failed ding 800x 3mod on ar6 edit thats awesome

i get a lot of stupid messages but this is probably one of the weirdest interactions on osu ive had in a bit

turning moderately challenging maps i fced in 2017 into near 7 star bullshit is amazing

i teach computer science to middle/highschool kids online and this one parent's name is indimidating me

"first time in 2 years ive wanted to seriously improve, been going around 2009-2011 and 3modding maps on ar6 edits and GOD theres so much i want to fc... all this stuff is 6-7 stars/cs6.5/od11 and its actually so much fun- this is only the beginning !"

willy is a beast

new player: how do i get good at osu?  experienced player: play more  new player: *plays more*  osu community: wtf ur only like supposed to play 2-3 hours a day why did you take our advice man your health is at risk

ppl saying this is bad are stupid because literally every mainstream esports pro clocks 10+/day  people barely play osu even at the top level and i commend the passion

im nuts

maps i missed go here:  thanks toy for finding   (running fire)

yo @elonmusk why did you black out

So excited for new attack the titan episode üëç

in 2017 i cheated a 96% on a random normal diff and none of you will ever know which one üòé

people actually thinking they can argue with adam on what makes a good alt map

now that riri made me remember it exists i need someone to play thru pokemon insurgence as i play thru it again so i can have someone to trade/battle with please i beg...

Officially a @belle_delphine_ bronze tier patron! üëç Excited to show more support in the future üòÅ

"""perfect"""

yeah i made a tier list where toy isnt S so what

like this tweet and i put u on a tierlist (people i know only)

"now that people are approaching ""osu endgame"", I made a list of every map 2007-2010 that still has unique score potential, e.g. maps with no (HD)DT fcs or some equivalent  i think i got them all, but i may have missed a few    I'll do 2011-12 and 13-14 soon"

ive never been so proud of @Chippy_NE

new house üòÄüëç

like how is deconstruction star 99.5 1xsb an actual score that can happen

2019 fucking blows you actually have to be god to even be considered decent

so much zetsubou in the air today

just had a dream where billie eilish dommed me

my mom thinks shes alpha for playing sean kingston - beautiful girls in the car but little does she know im #1 on that song in osu

been playing ftb for 6 years and just learned you can put casts in a pattern chest wtf

ive always been heavily in favor of crimson but you guys are useless man like who gets exactly 50-50 on a poll

ktgster should be 2 digit because he does all his plays with default skin

"if an 18 year old gets nudes from a 15 year old hes NOT a pedophile, hes a piece of shit  are you gonna tell me that if people ages 14-17 date its not pedophilia but the next year it is?   stop throwing around the p word when its not justified"

i was about to get the first hdhr fc on a ~2 year old map but my grandma came into my room and told me i was ruining my future by playing too many games and i failed

fangzy broke our streak of Five days im fuming

rookie mistake

my grandma is suing someone for several million usd thats so beast

TIL dropping a sliderend earlier in the map is ‚Äúworse‚Äù scorewise than dropping one at the end of a map- the exact opposite of regular 100s

my younger brother is a boomer

why does there exist a map where the only DT fcs are vinxis and rlc

good morning

mappers that spam perfect stacks and then complain about their map being underplayed

spare near distant future

Wow i am so proud to finally say i have achieved a #1 score on a map by OSU MAN himself. truly my magnum opus

"streamer appreciation tweet  i just had a six digit sit in my spec for an hour saying ""pog"" and ""Big acc"" every 2 seconds to the point where i just quit the game  how you guys tolerate this as a career is beyond me"

unexpected osu fact: a bit over 3% of all ranked maps get hit by the hatsune miku keywords  thats a big ass number

further proof theres no difference between 6 and 2 digit

"mini scoredump, 4 cool #1s ive gotten in the past few days"

i hope whoever invented the slider stream gets restricted

"GUESS THE PLAYER #24  last one for the night, and the hardest i believe- i checked with a friend, this is NOT bullshit  first solve gets big respect points in my book  (reupload, put in the wrong order before)"

"GUESS THE PLAYER #23  last one was a bit bullshit cause of how unknown the guy was, my bad  i personally really like this one"

GUESS THE PLAYER #22  another hard one

"GUESS THE PLAYER #21  a bit of a more unknown player (reupload, first image was wrong)"

e

GUESS THE PLAYER #20  20!! so heres an especially hard one  do you guys want me to keep uploading these vvv

GUESS THE PLAYER #19  degenerate clues

GUESS THE PLAYER #18  a bit tricky i think

GUESS THE PLAYER #17  the internet may be useful here

GUESS THE PLAYER #16  osu related clue for an osu player seems fitting

"GUESS THE PLAYER #15  made so many of these earlier today, having a lot of fun with it"

GUESS THE PLAYER #14  think phonetically

GUESS THE PLAYER #13   i love anime

"GUESS THE PLAYER #11  and no, its not mismagius"

"10th anniversary of minecraft wow, time flies"

not really impressive cuz it was 1 try but the fact this is 7.2 stars now is haha  and people are supporting the cs6 buff because...?

if i break this mindblock i fc the map i hate 900-1000x man....

"about people reacting to the idke clip:   stop being a baby like honestly banter makes everything more fun, the superficial 'lets all be friends"" attitude is irritating and its ok for people to call each other out"

when mappers are mapping really well do they get nerves when they place objects

my mom just asked me if i have ever edated

play wynncraft with me

now that raniemi has done the disgusting act of faking his/her death can we ban their cheated scores now

why are so many good osu players short

nevo maps are actually super fun (the not pp ones)

this new snapchat filter sucks it ruins my alpha look

urban dictionary is beast

why did my phone autocorrect thanks to cookiezi

thanks to my friend aefrogdog for showing me what i think is the most retarded replay ever in osu. hope you all enjoy this  (skip to 36 seconds for the fainthearted)

"crazy how peppy's cutting edge spinner changes make it so that spinners that are too fast u auto miss on, wizards of winter is actually now almost impossible to pass"

most aesthetic 2 seconds of osu

free sevenend7

reverse matrix

no sliderends missed

awesome map @REFORMEDawnsday

going to put this comment on like 50 videos in hope i get efame

might fuck around and make an extensive osu quiz just to give it to peppy and see how much of his game he actually knows

",No, you can either stop or be restricted for life.  Regards, osu! support"

glad we have a dev that knows what ar10.3 is

crazy that there are actually people who think adjustable AR is a healthy change to the game

officially confirmed im going to incel north this year see u all there : )

any mutuals want to play anime music quiz

"just fced 250 maps in one osu session, cool"

why do people complain about anime backgrounds being nsfw when theres a blurred out scrotum in the background video of bad elixir (ranked feb 2019)

big number

please mom i just want an fc to overwrite the choke

actual hell to acc but at least i got the ddm snipe

i fucking love you @xasuma

kroytz osu facts are things the map2chart bot would post if it became sentient

"first adam now robert, the osu redemption arc has begun"

another score i looked up to 3+ years ago that ive beaten

"kind of tilted that we have so many cool featured artists now (helblinde, cranky, etc..) yet people still feel the need to rank songs such as Matsuda Arisa (CV: Murakawa Rie) - Chou Jou Genki Show*Idol ch@ng!"

uc berkeley full ride

+ ESPECIALLY to dawnsday. i get theyre both on appeal and should be on good behavior. james having a school shooter pic is shitty. but dawnsday was just IN THE COLLAB AS A RANDOM BLACK GUY and may have to wait 6 months to be free. Blatant bias and power abuse from the staff side.

"this james and dawnsday restrict is actually the most bullshit thing ever, fuck off to whoever decided it was worth a restrict instead of a silence"

adamqs 3mod fc science is fun

omg a chikatto chika chika mapset with a diff named sans fujiwara was ranked on my bday today is awsome already

this tweet is fucking horrible

just saw an ahegao hoodie for the first time i didnt actually realize people actually wear them in public

Jairo Jameson

twitter just glitched for sec and it showed that andrew yang scoreposted senseless massacre and i was so confused

why right when nitroz name revert i get new impersonator

hello denizens of twitter i have been using really shitty headphones for the past 2 years and i wanna get new ones but am clueless about good brands/models  whats a good pair of over-ear headphones that aren't really 'gaming headphones' (any price)

TIL beasttrollmc didnt know who arnold was until yesterday   i love the dude and all but thats kinda scary how ootl he is

ok i know this is the fourth highest diff of a mapset thats going to be incredibly underplayed but this is probably my best slider score

theres no way people actually enjoy listening to some of the anime stuff that gets ranked theres absolutely no way

why mappers make alt dt maps with one random triple

thank U @MismagiusBD for making this the first map* to have a different mod combo in each spot of the top 8 (Cool osu moments)  *as far as we know

i just broke a 100$ bill at a burger king

ok im done i need to sleep if i hurt ur feelings im sorry i didnt mean it unless you're aiden

been seeing a lot of positivity on my timeline so like this tweet and i'll insult u

im so happy with this jesus christ

NVM I FUCKING DID IT

i dont even care i missed the last note this is easily one of my favorite plays

"did this a few hours ago, 100x away from max combo and really hope i can get this soon  this song is so good"

fat man summoning ritual

"thanks to @MismagiusBD i have been informed this map has been ranked for 9 years and 364 days, so I was actually one day away from first FC on a map in a decade  are you kidding me"

better player wins

only osu veterans will understand

alfarshear

"fun fact: if every map ranked after 2012 were nuked, @Arnold24x24 would be rank 2 global behind cookiezi"

goodbye best alt play of my life (would've sniped robert)

my little bro got into an ivy league college this is a proud older brother moment

"4 very different types of scores, im happy with all of them- good day today :- )"

mindblocking on a cardinality proof :/

randomizer89

why are people with usernames that are just random letters and numbers always chinese or korean

hey @ppy when you're #2 on a map and #1 gets banned (you get a new #1) that score doesnt go on the list of #1s on your profile.. is there any potential fix for this in the future?

so many people getting restricted my kokoro cant take this much longer üò≠

im gonna start wearing a gauze around my wrist for the aesthetic

blazink wont rabbit chika with me üò°

no matter how hard i try i always find reasons to think of fat man please come back adami miss u

cookiezi mutual is cool but do you have the pink heart with a branch of math itself

breaks my heart that new players will have an entire osu career and never experience a live arakune improvement stream

imagine caring about mwc when ur still a worse mapper than angelhoney

hey

explain yourself @REFORMEDawnsday

cool

spinning is genetics

i miss adamqs

the vomiting muppet commercial should be fucking banned from all media

FOLLOW FUWZIE he has a twitter now !

why do people put a screenshot of their lowest UR at the top of their userpage if its above 80 thats like publicly announcing you're disabled

i have been successfully reminded the hard way that food poisoning is beyond awful

i got 1.5b score today just so i could take this screenshot and never play a marathon ever again

i was really impressed by passara's score on this so i beat it in the least impressive way possible

osugame does not deserve this brain

how did xilver dt ding with 99

walking in the cold listening to halcyonic falcon x

"yo @corbinbleu @MrGrabeel i fced i dont dance, thoughts?"

im so good im #1 and #2 on this map

hmm today i will snipe haxwell on ar6 od6 maps

TIL someone paid LS (league of legends analyst) to coach them for osu! 3 years ago even though he knows nothing about the game

lithuanians have the best gamer genes and there is very little u can do to change my mind

hmmm today i will farm

"i might be spending July studying abroad in EU and these 4 countries have programs with my uni  if i could pick any, which would be the most fun?"

really excited for the gen8 legendary pokemon swordar and shieldior that look like stock images of a sword and shield respectively

just took a 2 hour exam behind someone with a shirt that said 'the 2016 dick bouldering competition' which is basically the exam equivalent of playing osu with combo bursts on

kevin is a fucking warrior

that was the most fun normals have ever been thanks for all who played

anyone wanna multi normal diffs with the SQUAD

i am confused by so many things in this image

also this genius is why i am a mighty osx user and you all are not

"one of my #1s was about to get sniped so i called the sniper on discord during the play and my score is intact, this is objectively the most efficient way of protecting scores"

when i first started playing osu i was fully convinced anyone who could hdhr this was a wizard so this feels really cool solely for nostalgic reasons

osu is a well coded game part 1298467329

4.94 STARS MY ASS

skillet song but with fate grand order music video

dude what the hell was i on in 2017

not to flex or anything but i have the most max-mod *NSYNC fcs in the entire fucking game

"why is everyone here treating valentines day as a day of lonely grieving, just live the same as you always have and if you have an SO the more power to you"

yo @ppy is it possible for the new website to have an official 'amount of #1s leaderboard/amount of top50s leaderboard/amount of country #1s leaderboard' without having to resort to external sites like osu!stats (e.g.   ? that would be super cool

TIL you can add a map to collections while spectating/watching a replay  this is easily both the most useless button ever and also the most in plain sight thing that i have never bothered to notice

"i turned on quality filter for tweets and somehow the amount of no cap clantags on my tl doubled, how did this option have the reverse effect"

despite this pp change being in the right direction the ego inflation of speed players has made me consider how worth it really is

does this game kill brain cells to the point where this is what stream names look like now

nothing against the score but honestly what a stupid fucking song name to have the pp record on

adamqs has the n word pass

one of these is not like the others

just spent 3 hours reading about spheres for an assignment i am all powerful

wish someone with true genetics like magnus carlsen played osu to show that genes do exist for this game

new star rating system made it a little easier but got my first cs8 6star fc which is still pretty cool

im sure everything will be correct in the end but i have absolutely no idea why this is a thing right now (two identical scores updated to different pp values)

"thought id take this time to find a few of the many weird things that end up in my top 100 plays after the update, this is pretty neat !"

thank you news for you feature u never let me down i really wanted to know the resolution to this dilemma

"bohemian rhapsody subtweet  whats the point in making people excited for a map (bc of a hype song), then not making a spread so its inaccessible to most players, and on top of that making it super uncomfortable/unfun to play for those who are able to do it"

just choked a #1 cuz my french bread pizza finished heating in the microwave and the beep was really loud

day 2 of being blocked by pasonia i just picked up some bemani games and can see why they are objectively superior to osu and its shitty pirated music

4 digit player thats better at speed than dsan better at acc than toy and better at gimmick than ddm still isnt banned

james literally got suspended on twitter for calling an angry 30 year old singaporean bemani enthusiast black in dms

mmmm yes two early morning megurine luka #1s i like i like

looking for egirl with and im home in their top plays

netflix should make a queer eye but for osu players where instead of getting 5 gay guys to teach u fashion they give u a temporary girlfriend

was not expecting an osu reference here LOL

the partof the menu where you select your skin without hitting preview gameplay should be at least 6 stars

just want to take a second to give this play some attention cuz i think this is the coolest thing in 2019 so far (probs tied with aireu motorcycle chase) and i NEED this play to get some recognition

just did my bimonthly watch of mandelbrot set

i swear to fucking god if this girl wasnt wearing airpods this would be the easiest #1 of my life

i feel like im the only person that just does not enjoy playing smash

can anyone here help a brother out and give me a comprehensive proof of why limits are unique

random thought: if zestiny posted a 3 star play on an unranked map no one has heard of with the caption 'MY BEST SPEED PLAY' it would get 200 likes bare minimum and tons of replies complimenting the play

because everyone is doing it

decided to make one : )

deadass how do mapper-only ppl vote in community choice if u need to play the map to be able 2 vote for like ??? this is stupid

this is ridiculous my arm buzzed at 3:30am telling me to stand when im trying to SLEEP

ever since i got this fucking apple watch its been making fun of me 24/7

arguably the hardest 4 star map to s rank in the game (?)

hot air balloon is impossible woey cheats

i never actually saw this until now and this is probably the highest iq bounty ever to be made

"this score is pretty neat but what makes this especially stupid is that the diddy kong racing announcer yelling stuff like ""LAP TWO"" is plastered all over the map at about 5x the song volume my ears are bleeding"

life is unfair why was i not born an aquarius

guminis is the best player in osu sorry cookiezi

people who shame doubletapping but are fine with tapx

"just got on my train back to college, train that showed up at the station was not the one that goes from NY-&gt;boston, had to get out at the first stop with 50 other people that got fucked, ubered back to the station and have to pay a 50$ fee to change my ticket im fuming"

oh shit a cool rock song that is totally unrelated to anime got ranked... oh

maybe a bit of a morbid thought but is there any security system in place for osu! if peppy unexpectedly dies?   like could one car accident potentially mean the cut of all payments for the servers/website to be up -&gt; game dies for good

only thing more nerve wracking than getting a cool play is mining straight down

everyone please please upvote this bounty ty @genius_user

amane is my favorite artist to be mapped because it is only 1 letter different than pokimane's first name (imane)

"im broke someone put bounties on either lunatic red eyes (innocent key), 1000 phantasm, or revenG hddt please &gt;_&lt;"

NEVER MIND 300 TRIES AND 5 HOURS LATER UGIRJOKR#E@  i propose a pp system where ur rank is determined by number of epic justin timberlake plays u have

A MOTHJUST FUCKING CRAWLED ON ME AS IWAS TRYINGN TO SLEEP  FUCK VACATIONING TO THE THIRD WORLD

as per tradition i am purchasing hanukkah cards for all members of my hyper christian family

my goal for when the new pp system comes out is to find every single new farm map in the game and tell absolutely no one about them

why are all russian players and mappers cooler than their non russian counterparts

add meo n osu please i beg

theres this guy at the train station whos been playing a guitar with broken strings with his eyes closed for almost 30 mins now when will he stop

if this change goes through cillit bang is gonna be the rog unlimitation for 5 digits but worse

just checking out the new pp changes and finding out my doubletapped 5.6 star 86% fc on a map from 2008 thats literally just a stack goes from 171 -&gt; 262 (91 pp gain!!)  pls make acc scale exponentially as the strain on a map increases ty

on mobile and uploading images isnt working for some reason but pretend i did that same impression tweet everyone else did

this tweet is now irrelevant i have successfully traded with a follower

does anyone have a discord nitro gift that they are willing to trade with me

just fced 30 totino's pizza rolls

reminder that two sliders that perfectly overlap each other is unrankable because everyones reading sucks but ambiguous/unfollowable sliderart is ok if your name is sotarks and you include a tutorial on how to hit it in the map description

.... at least im consistent

damn years of self deprecating tweets may be finally worth it

damn i guess bubbleman really is a black belt

ughhh just spilled fun dip on my keyboard guess i have to quit osu now

this score is dedicated to my friend @rtaMxi with his assistance i have made it to the moon

played* not playing my english died for a second

"in all the countless hours i have playing osu, I have never seen this before  two scores with completely different accuracies having EXACTLY the same score"

"maybe unpopular opinion but a pp rework that correctly implements speed and stamina but neglects precision, note density, and difficult finger control/acc is by no means complete"

"if every sotarks map was replaced with a 2011 nightcore jericho2442's rave diff, poverty would end"

just had a really realistic nightmare about having to room with a chad

osu! needs more iglu and hartly

+how can people get excited during a tb if literally no one knows where the hard parts are

correct me if im wrong but arent tiebreaker maps supposed to be hype  and isnt the easiest way to make something hype just by picking a well known really hard map  and isnt an unranked map with a german sentence for the diffname the farthest thing possible from that criteria...?

i dont give a shit no one knows this map this is actually so fucking sick

fun hvick stats:  he has 171 #1s remaining  93 of which are SS  24 of which have no spinners  this is gonna be fun

was expecting once all rrtyui's #1s to be taken some end game content would randomly appear with a hidden final boss tier score   sad this game has no route called 'rrtyui true end'

osu conspiracy theory: idke did #1 on 11/24 with 981pp 1124-981=143 idke is level 104 143/104 =11/8 flip the digits you get 88/1 and since idke is #1 add 1 to the denominator and subtract 1 from digits in numerator and you get 77/2 rearrange to get 727 idke is cookiezi confirmed

imagine a universe where the replay of the top score of one of the most popular rhythm games is copyrighted

#HappyThanksgiving

my 7 year old brother was watching minecraft vids all day and then refused to sit at our table for thanksgiving cuz he said i looked like herobrine

i hope when all of rrtyuis tops get taken he comes back just to set a 0 spinner 4mod easy diff #1 and then disappears again

spinner only restricted himself so he can get 200bil more score in secret and then when he gets unrestricted he just becomes insta #1 score

#NewProfilePic

imagine quitting osu for 6 years just to come back and rank the same song again

my proudest top50

why i study higher math/cs  get a good job to secure my future: ew no  enroll in stupid classes: obviously

wolf says the n-word feat

pretty much everyone has already wished @ToybickIer a fantastic 21st birthday so im gonna use this tweet to let you guys know that the first anime that 'our wholesome boy' watched was highschool dxd

i was just exploring the depths of 2009 and found a background video of a ranked map where theres a whipping and then a zoom in on the bleeding cuts

this has to be one of the weirdest leaderboards in the game

at a five guys and there are actually five guys behind the counter this is so cool

i mean i dont wanna point my finger but this seems a little more out of touch than i thought

man im in lecture and i must look like an idiot giggling at my computer when everyone else is falling asleep

"only legit player is xasuma because no one is autistic enough to cheat 50,000 scores"

lol @ all the people who thought -gn was being a dick for publicly calling out you know who

if zestiny was the best [anything thats not speed] player in the game this 1E308 drama wouldnt exist

got clapped by adamqs in shogi and my confidence is at an all time low

useless osu statistic: i have the 8th most amount of #8 scores in the game

xilver please have my children

goijg on a 43 hour walk good thing i have all this osu instrumental music to listen to

wtf how did ahri get all the infinity stones

really sad it isnt #btsarmy doing the worlds opening ceremony

tweet of the year

ppl are just mad at cheaters cuz they dont know how to cheat themselves

i never realized how flat miley is until playing this for 45 minutes straight

wait zektbach ranked in 2018 what timeline am i in

wow cookiezi hit 150bpm streams with 230 bursts at 96% really insane play

just listened to cycle hit as i brushed my teeth and u guys cannot fathom how pearly white they are now

all of you at twitchcon may be enjoying yourself but i just watched someone fill up a bottle with water just to dump it out again like 10 times in a row just because he liked watching the water come out of the faucet

thinking about getting a name change on osu to kiritofan123

"this is basically a time capsule for my opinions on maps, but I thought I'd put it here if anyone is insane enough to read this monstrocity"

Mapping: For the players  Read:

"23rd person to have 10k S, and only other american besides xasuma. 19 people have 10k SSes, and 14 of them are 1-3 star players, oppososed to 3/23 10k S players   gonna take a small break from playing, and either later tonight/tmrw will write what its like playing tons of maps"

"this feels so cool  something ive wanted to have for almost 3 years now i think, i'll probably be the last player to ever see this while the old site lasts too.   to make it memorable, the last one was a 0% bg dim, default skin darude sandstorm fc   (more below)"

wait @MismagiusBD i just realized your big black remap is 7.27 stars i actually hate you

"PSA: ranked maps appear in #announce now, so put ""ranked!"" in your highlighted words and you'll get a highlight whenever a new map gets ranked"

le freedom dive cookiezi is not 1000pp after rework? this system is seriously flawed and we should not adopt it.

every now and then i get mortified about the time i tried to invite someone to a discord server but linked a fanzhen trap image instead

its the time of year again when we vote for which deviantart submission we want as the main menu background

no one here probably knows this but this acc is honestly unreal

s3rl is for people who like nightcore but havent come out yet

going to get a razer laptop so i can seamlessly run microsoft word

at the risk of sounding uncultured:  why do so many high profile mappers put laurier as their inspiration/respect mapper?  everything of theirs seems (to me at least) fairly generic and doesnt really stand out (even in the context of maps around the time they were active)

"just got 2 #1s practically back to back, i think thats pretty cool"

how many times do i have to play the new sao opening to free kirito from the game world

just remembered french is an actual language and not just an inside joke between all french people

thanks for the suggestion but i will humbly decline

"i usually try really hard to find stuff i like about maps  but i think i have zero hesitation in saying that hailie and UC's collab on warning x warning x warning is the single worst thing ive ever seen in the ranked section, its honestly impressive"

i keep getting mobile anime game ads on youtube so i left a green day playlist on auto for 4 hours and theyre gone im so smart

if u have good scores but ur username has a bunch of retarded numbers at the end i will automatically assume u are a cheater

how has the onion not gotten suspended here yet

might fuck around and use fossil fuels today

someone in my notifications has osu in their username twice that is like unmatched level of dedication

rohulk sounds like a foreign squidward

i wanna try mapping things for rank so i can show people its possible for low star maps of good non anime/wub songs can be fun as hell but on the other hand i dont want to deal with being irrationally disregarded for doing things outside the norm

undefined fantastic object

why does peppy even bother to type anything ever in # osu when this is the GUARANTEED tier of response

id rather just talk to ghosts with my ouija board

watching league of legends world championship is reassuring cause it reminds me there are people who completely devote their life to something for 8 years and still have no idea how to do it

wubwoofwolf is best player because he has ss on pokemon theme normal diff no one else has ss

quitting osu to spam puzzlehunts

"just thought of an amazing username idea, u take what u currently have and surround it with brackets and dashes like [-this-] wow this is so cool"

why are the most philosophical things on my TL by either kanye or norm kelly

"+to add, ""magic numbers"" (in this case 500) are the benchmark of a NOVICE PROGRAMMER and should not be arbitrarily implemented without SERIOUS reason"

"reminder of 3 things people seem to have forgotten  pp is intrinsically a system to rate plays, not players  most of the most absurd gimmick plays are under 500 objects  the way your best plays interact to form a rank can easily be changed by swapping the scaling coefficients"

guys i propose they nerf the rook in chess i keep falling victim to it

why people get mad that the pp system doesnt cater to 5 digits when literally every big game's changes cater exclusively to the pro scene

imagine coding a super in depth neural network that understands what images people tend to find aesthetic and check on it just to find it spitting out doujin screencaps

this guy in the row ahead of me in lecture is playing bedwars do i ask to join his party

listening to 3oh!3 in 2018 my power is unmatched

why is my tl not 100% bowsette what did i do to deserve this

its also very clear whoever wrote this has no idea in the vast difference between maps as they age from 2007-2012

"this actually makes me mad, even though this will never end up happening, these maps are finite- a small group of ~10k maps that shine in a different light than anything today, and they should stay like that  trying to change that is disrespectful"

edit: 3 badges could be switched to 3 tournament wins but i dont think people have incentive to farm wins where they have nothing to show for

"proposal to the tournament scene:   if a player has 3 badges, give them the priority of a rank 500 (number could vary based on tournament)  this way, people can only be a sandbagger for a limited time before receiving special treatment  problem solved"

5 respect points to toy for being the only person to realize my previous tweet was bait

"it always disheartened me to see all the 'legends' of osu to come from the eastern hemisphere, be it cookiezi, rrtyui, or hvick- but honestly after seeing idkes scores on virgin code and satorare i think theres finally hope to see someone from the west join those names"

"i dont mean to bring negativity to the timeline, but havent felt too mentally well recently so made a private @jw_irl   if you're a friend of mine feel free to follow if you want"

"i have lost a massive amount of respect for gayzmcgee... after realizing how shaky his aim is I've come to realize he has terrible execution, meaning he's been a fake speed player this whole time"

fuckin hate what youtube puts in my recommended now like i just wish i could go back to the days it would tell me to watch more three days grace naruto amvs

"Super low bpm plays are not respected by the community as much as low bpm players would want them to be because if you sped  MOST of those plays up to 250bpm, then it would look like 4 monkeys trying to play TAG4"

its been two whole hours and no one has posted this on osugame im genuinely dissapointed in you all

never will i understand why the new osu site changed from /b/ and /s/ links to /beatmapsets/ like thats easier to type in any world

the most depressing thing about osu nowadays is that no one ranks maps about touhou girls making fun of each others' chests anymore

i have 2 hours to kill in class ama

respect player: all ranked score players with cool scores

osu is not a rhythm game but instead a game with rhythmic components if u say otherwise ur mad

hi top 25 video maker why no magnolia hddt for cookiezi

my dad drenched our sofa with water and thought he could get the water out by bringing the cushions outside and driving over them  i guess being disabled runs in my family

why do people think 1000 hours is a large amount of playtime while in other mainstream games everyone has like 2-3k

"woey is a modest man, that time to air score is actually one of the best reading scores in the game and the reddit post is sitting at around 40 upvotes right now im literally crying"

fuck i just choked big black

rt thelewas malnourished leg for good accuracy to come your way

my pet peeve is people who post 7 second 'godmode' clips of them fcing half of the hard part with combo accuracy keypresses and hit error disabled in the replay

"day 24 without osu every sound i hear i imagine a hitcircle or slider associated with it depending on the length or type of noise, every time i use a pen i envision a cursor trail, i forgot every human has an arbitrary number assigned to them that determines their social worth"

the irl equivalent of a walking intensive quest in an rpg is taking a long car ride with an extremely foreign uber driver

"I love questions like ""do u like RLC maps"" where if you say yes I can flame you for being mainstream and if u say no I can flame u for being tasteless"

"no new information from this for me, but this may be the single best osu tutorial a player can have. definitely worth your 7 minutes"

imagine blaming lag @Mismagius_BD

"kiss me thru the phone is objectively better than turn my swag on, i will accept no counterarguments"

people PLEASE stop bitching about losing pp cuz if u lose less pp than the people similar to your rank than you will gain ranks lol outsmarted

ok out of sheer curiosity which of these val0108 gumi maps/songs is best

holy SHIT

3/4 there w

like for a direct cause im bored as shit

currently on a walk listening to my nightcore youtube playlist at 1.5 speed

all i want is for japan to play osu again

osu does not need more lower star difficulties   HOWEVER  osu DOES need many more lower star difficulties with effort put into them

only reason I came to pax was to meet cookiezi anyone know where he is

hey guys can confirm @Chippum_ does smell a bit like baby wipes

why does the outside of pax look like a prison

outskilled

nice

can we bring back old pp+ so I can have 500 on courage the cowardly dog and toy can have a 400pp play on a 1.9* map

jericho2442 is the best mapper osu has ever seen if you think otherwise you are wrong

my favorite part about the new mobile site is that the score leaderboard doesn't even show score

"context: random 90k player messages me about ""how to get over a skill wall"" and i try to give an actual response  i actually am in awe that newer players are headed in this direction"

just finished going through all the individual songs   now i just need to get lucky and ill be the second ever fc on the full 26 minute diff

"first time sniping an FL score with DT, feels really awesome and weird at the same time"

oh yeah this too

top 10 butthurt osu moments 2018

because azer will be too embarassed to make this public information:  woey now has the most hidden first place scores

call me crazy but this seems doable in the near future

"yo @ppy cool graphs on the profile but all the data is off by one month   (that february should be march), same goes for all months for all players on both play count and replays watched graphs  also maybe add a box around the graphs so it looks a little less sloppy"

holy shit bros...

god i love when my mans from 2008 gets 50 more combo than an SS

i dont give a shit what anyone says this is the fucking highlight of my entire osu career

"edgy opinion:  despite being insanely impressive, an hd fc on shotgun symphony+ is not even close to the pinnacle of old map reading/aim whatsoever"

why do neither of these graphs exist on the new site @ppy

daily random fun osu fact #1  beatmap pack 287 is the only non-mania beatmap pack with a mania set in it  reason being that the set was mapped by DJPop so it was just put into a pack because it was automatically assumed everything he made was for standard

"reached 2000 hours today, time flies  thanks everyone for making this game so great"

anyone that claims that digitalhypno does not farm badges has clearly not realized that he has a GREEK DUO CUP BADGE on his profile

I sincerely apologize for retweeting anime

not gonna lie i went full abyssal fcing ror reaction after this one   but seriously im so fucking happy with this holy shit

bakari is the only person that can save mapping

no doubt in my mind this is the best map of 2018 so far  everyone should play it

"Although WWW and -GN have 3 mod FCs on this, this is the first HDDT/HDNC FC on the map (AR6+3mod = ~AR10, not AR11 scores)  really good AR8 HD score!"

"he may be good in email/1 on 1 discussion, but he presents his public self horribly as the figurehead of a fairly large game"

"hate to be that guy but seriously why is peppy's natural response to any critique about the game just obnoxious and/or toxic  it seems any suggestion of how osu can be better is a personal attack towards him; he refuses to listen and gives a reply that might as well be ""no u"""

this is a good score btw

not on my fucking watch haxwell

i just got autofailed for over FCing LOL

jehlp osu's objective best correct list of best maps certified through ranked status in 2017

so sad to me that many new players havent even heard of so many nostalgic maps like magic girl / and im home  it kinda just hit me all at once that im just really sad about how osu now guides newer players on the path to rarely experience maps that are truly either good or fun

bros im boutta hit up japan for a week anything i like gotta see/do/get

"wow logan paul was born on april fools, I guess he was born to be a joke"

"I just said ""Hi, Ty"" unironically and then realized what truly just came out of my mouth"

it took me less than 50 days to go from 2k S ranks to 3k S ranks what the fuck

complaint #3) they didnt choose any actual prominent community members (players) to talk about an issue that is about the player community

complaint #2) no one (especially happystick) knew what maps were loved in general so they never gave examples except graces of heaven/arles

complaint #1) topic was about the future of loved and they didnt mention any changes even once

"i may be just really bad at listening comprehension, but did anyone get anything out of that coffee house episode?"

things like this make me happy

i think ima go on a quest to play every ranked map

ok so el chapo has a bounty on trump lmao what is this world

I'm would fine with pp mapping if players couldn't shit out 550+ scores with half the max combo 90 accuracy and 10 misses

finally waaiiru is top 100! he deserves it

why are rechargable batteries a thing no one ever recharges them

Jingle bass is so hard

"how is toybot's insane on euclid only 4.6 stars? And yes, I did miss the very last note ;-;"

i think im gonna stop playing for pp except when a new pp map comes out and focus solely on getting unique top 10 scores now

TIL Singapore is only 65 years old

That beastmode map is actually pretty cool

Only three more days left of work and then I can actually set some cool scores
