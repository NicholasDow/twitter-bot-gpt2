I am Libertarian. I ran for Potus in 2016.   Many in our party believe income taxes are unconstitutional. I speak out loudly against it. There are other means of funding.   I have not committed fraud. I have refused to file - a misdemeanor.   This extradition is political.
Happy thanksgiving all. I'm feeling slightly better. May you all have a wonderful turkey day.
"Prison is a reflection of the world at large, but here, the human condition is condensed into a stark reality you cannot unsee.   Ugly aspects of the human condition are magnified, but so is the spirit of compassion as seen in the ""todo bien"" uttered by all.  It is enlightening."
"This is @theemrsmcafee. Thank you all for your help, I was able to find what I needed. John is ok but he hasn't been feeling well. Its not covid related but his health is declining. He'll be back to tweeting himself once his health allows. I'll keep you updated from my account."
This is a recent Independent article about my situation.
"Prison here is: doing what you're told, keeping to schedules and routines, dissatisfaction and grumbling, and dealing with dangerous, annoying, or meaningless relationships.  Not much different from the average job holder with a family."
"In the chaos of prison - frustration, anger and resentment - there are many who retain what humanity they can.   In passing some smiling stranger may pat my back or gently squeeze my arm in a friendly manner and I do the same.  Compassion can't be taken from those who possess it."
AOC wants a Twitter list of those complicit in whatever evils Trump has done by implicitly supporting him.   As far as listings go wouldn't we be better served by a list of who's paying who and for what in the halls of congress?
Denmark to kill millions of minks because they carry CV.   We killed them before by the millions because we loved their fur.  We kill them out of love. We kill them out of fear.  Humans must be incomprehensible to them.  We certainly are to me.
McDonald's and Pizza Hut to offer vegetarian meat substitutes.   I bet the cows are partying.
"While I have been detained, the team at @GhostbyMcAfee has been working tirelessly to deliver on my vision: real privacy for real people.   This is the power of decentralization."
If I ran this prison the first thing I would do is hire a Feng Shui consultant.

"Theft among inmates does not happen in this prison.   The reason, I suspect, has less to do with morality then the fact that we have nothing to steal.  Except the clothes on our backs.  And I've yet to hear of a single inmate running naked through the yard looking for revenge."
"I wonder if a case of Tesla Tequila will now come with every new Tesla car?   After all, what does drunk driving mean when you're in a self driving car."
Someone stole a broom from the kitchen.   Doesn't seem like much but talented artistry can turn a broom into any number of deadly weapons.  A full search of the cells was made for the broom. Wasn't found.  I believe whatever fucker stole it simply jumped on it and flew away.
"Notes from prison:   Time passes, but you have to squint to notice it in here."
"Government bureaucrats, can store documents, modify them, erase them, or, if it suits them, create them out of thin air.   Do not forget that votes are documents."
Society requires rules. You don't like the rules? Play a different game - your own.
"If the ""news"" had any baring on reality, the nightly news would be called the nightly truth.   Oh... for such a world."
"If you don't know what you don't know, you will never look for it.   I promise you, there is much you don't know about this election."
A young lady is in the prison who seemingly was imprisoned halfway through a sex change.   He/she is in love with a young man. They spend all day together.   When we return to our cells I pass them on the stairs clinging to each other and crying.  Clearly they don't share a cell.
"In Spanish prisons, men are, oddly, never naked among themselves.   Even in showers men where their underpants.   At first I found it prudish, but on reflection it certainly makes picking up the soap much safer."
"Advertising, marketing and propaganda technology is extremely advanced, making you feel like things you never really desired.   Like the status quo of a system offering choices which, in the end, benefit no one outside the systems elite."
"Goals are healthy - become a ship's captain, a surgeon, a carpenter. Good stuff.   But the goal of attaining social status in a society gone mad?  I just don't know what to say."
"We face a dying natural world, mindless jobs, powerlessness, reduced human contact ...   Politics didn't do this.   Corporations, who now supercede presidents, have turned people and nature into cogs of their system.   They should be the ones on stage."
"Just a few days until the election madness is over.   No matter the results in three months no one, except the elite, will notice a single change in your life."
The election is fun to watch?   The post election chaos should be a blast.
"What work do our politicians do?   Apparently a lot. But be certain of this:  Whatever it may be, their own interests is the motivation for it."
"I'm in prison for refusing to file tax returns, while government bureaucrats use your taxes for private planes, lavish parties and all other benefits of their power.   If you think this election, whatever its results, will change this system, you will be sadly disappointed."
"Prison rule #3   Never snitch to the guards for any offense.   I have been moved again to an even more undesirable cell block and my new friend said: ""if someone steals from you stab them when they're not looking.""  Not my style."
The office of president began as head servant to the people.   Somehow over the years it has become our head master's quarters.
"The election is America's greatest sports pastime. With leagues, playoffs, cheerleaders, referees and mascots.   The difference is that only the elite receive the betting payoff."
Lost tortoise Sparkplug found 30 miles from home.   An impossibility unless he hitched a few rides.
"""Lone policeman killed by rooster while breaking up cock fight in the Philippines""   Anyone who has actually seen a cock fight would know to send a swat team and still expect multiple casualties."
"Who gets your vote?   You decide based on a groomed public image, speaking words written by others - all beamed for your pleasure through the media.  The remaining 99% of their realities are invisible - except through the fog of accusations illuminated by their opponents."
God bless America!   We are certainly in need of blessing.
I have been moved to a new cell block.   Certainly not the most desirable cell block in the prison.   I am certain it's because I am still able to tweet despite my being in prison but I will continue to tweet no matter where I am.   I love you all.
I have witnessed 15 elections since I was 15 years old. Not one change of power wafted a single hair of the average citizen.   The only shift in wind were the fortunes of power lost by one group of elites to another.
"You would think a tiny cell and a prison yard as your only existence would be hell.   It isn't.   The lies, plots, rumors and deception here is identical to the world of politics.  The only difference is I get to experience it firsthand. You are condemned to watch it on the news."
The prosecutor claims I am wanted for murder in Belize. This is false. The Belizean authorities will confirm this.  I was a person of interest like all of the murdered man's neighbors. I chose not to be questioned.   I was already at war with the Belizean government.
"You think you are free because, unlike me, you are not in prison but you are in prison.   A prison whose bars are propaganda, a politically controlled media, and the increasing power of authority."
Prison rule #2   Be polite to guards and inmates alike.   Those who listened to their parents when young should have no problem in here.
"The economy is bad but for whom?   Congressmen do not lose their pay, their privileges, their homes.  Officials, bureaucrats and government employees do not get pay cuts.  A bad economy only affects we who carry the government on our shoulders."
When the income tax amendment was passed a max of 2% was required.   There was nearly an armed uprising.   Its now over 50% in some states.  Nothing but meek complaints. What happened to America?
I have answered questions from the European press.   To save repetition my answers to each question can be found here at    If you are an established media and have additional questions please address them to my wife by email at mrsjanicemcafee@gmail.com.
The problem with politics and the media is that you must separate the portrayed image from the reality of the person.   They are not one in the same.
Why not share the presidency.   Then nothing would get done in government.   A vast improvement.
I have been assigned a new table in the dining room. Each table seats four people. My new dining companions say nothing.   Absolutely nothing!  I guess that after many years in here there is nothing that remains to be said.
"If congressmen who make laws concerning prison sentences were required to spend a few weeks in prison prior to taking office,   I can assure you we would have a more just and humane system  of handling people who possess illegal drugs or commit non-violent offenses."
"We are not allowed to shower in our cells in the mornings until the guards open our doors and give us permission.   I decided, against my cell mate's urgent pleas, to shower early anyway.   Its not something I'm likely to try again."
"Prison guards from other prison blocks sometimes approach me, usually with smiles, wanting to meet the notorious McAfee.   Some even say ""if I can help, let me know.""  ""That's kind of you. Just let me out.""  No takers."
"Prison rule #1   Never give anyone a cigarette in the yard. Dozens more will demand one saying:  ""You gave Jose why not me?""  Refusals then escalate into animosity. When asked for one I say:  ""My wife took my money when I was locked up. I must ration.""  They seem to understand."
Today a new cell mate arrived. He's a cross between Charles Mason and Vin Diesel.   Did not elevate my mood any.
"There is sobbing in the cell next to mine each night. My heart goes out but I think he simply fails to see the adventure in our situation.   He speaks to no one, however, so I can't point out that we are living a true pirate like existence in here."
"Prison is an adventure to say the least.   Gang fights, threats, men muttering to themselves, theft, guards with advanced degrees in sadism, men pacing back and forth and a general sense of danger.  Just my type of place."
"I made friends with the inmate who stabbed many men. Other than stabbing folks, he's genuinely nice.   We talk politics and women. He says Clinton will be president and black women are best in bed.  We disagree politically, but I cannot fault his choice in women."
"Irrespective of the elections outcome, the political machine will be the only winner.   The American populace will be the loser."
I think the best means of deciding who to vote for would be to throw the contenders into prison and see which of the gangs they join.   That would demonstrate their true character.
Prison is no worse then living in your mother-in-law's house   with an overbearing spouse and ten children.
"Some have asked how to send me mail. My address is:   John McAfee Carretera de Martorell a Capellades, km 23 08635 Sant Esteve Sesrovires Centre Penitenciari Brians 1 Barcelona, Spain  Letters only. No packages.   No money, drugs or weapons please. Everything is opened."
"My words threaten the fabric of a stale and power hungry bureaucracy.   The average citizen is a pawn for that bureaucracy, to build the goods and services that the government bureaucracy consumes.   They need us.  Without our support their power is nothing."
I am charged with tax fraud - which is lying on your tax return.   I have filed no returns for many years and have made no secret of it. If I have said nothing how could I have lied.  My real crime is speaking publicly about the insanity rampant within our system of government.
PayPal to take crypto.   The IRS must be pissing itself.
The pope supports gay marriage.   Choir boys must be relieved.
No asks questions in prison. If a person wants to tell you about themselves they will.   The ones who have revealed bits and pieces to me have taught me more about life than four years of college.
"My Muslim cell mate departed today for the Muslim cell block - special food, special religious allowances.   He was replaced by a Russian with more tattoos than god. Mostly names of people he has murdered.  I'm certain to hear some extraordinary stories."
Trafficking in flying squirrels! Who could have guessed.   Better would be trafficking in politicians. We would then know the street value of our leaders.
"Inmates may spend 100 euros weekly. Pays for cigarettes.   We may also buy phone calls, 8 minutes each, and the number of calls depends on the guards moods.   I suspect inmates who provide sexual favors receive preferential treatment.   I'm waiting for a female guard."
Google charged with violating competition laws.   I wonder if Spanish Google officers might be chucked in here with me.   I have complaints of my own I would like to address personally with Google.
"Farmers in Pennsylvania caught fucking dogs, horses, goats, etc.   I hope the horse fuckers played the active role and not the passive.  Could be hazardous to health."
"This morning I was on the phone with @theemrsmcafee, discussing the election, when a major brawl materialized nearby. Had to hang up and distance myself so that I could watch.   Fascinating. Everyone should be allowed a prison experience."
Political battles are intense for one reason: if you can't retain a political position then who are you?   An ex someone who is now no one.
"In my cell is a sweet piece of graffiti in Spanish saying,   ""For 14 years I have been rehabilitated. I will now dedicate my existence to hatred. Fuck everyone"".  Cannot fault the man's honesty."
My Muslim cell mate insists he will only marry a virgin.  He will die a bachelor I fear.
What remains in America   is the last landscape   of a disappearing world.
"Compared to the usual political propaganda from the media,   masturbation news is refreshingly authentic."
"While fine food goes untouched and is thrown away in the mansions of our leaders, people are starving in the streets."
Consider the debates and animosity between the two chosen options of our government.   It is obvious that the America who once offered us George Washington and Abraham Lincoln has devolved into a caricature of itself.
I would not exchange my life in prison   for a life of freedom   in which I could not speak the truth.
"You want to know what prison is like,   It's like a Motel 6 run by Hitler's SS."
"If you are looking for a prison experience, rule number one is make friends with the meanest mother fucker you can find.   A multiple murderer who cannibalize his victims would be perfect.  Everyone else will leave you the fuck alone."
One advantage of prison is that you don't have to pay   thousands of dollars for a front row seat to   watch a first class fighting match.
"An immigrant arrived in my cell block today.   A sweet smile, charismatic with a charming disposition. The type of man a young woman might take home to her mother.  With a smile, he said he was here for beating a man to death.   ""He offended me"" he said.   I made a mental note."
My Muslim cell mate explained that if I die in the service of Allah I will receive 56 virgins when I go to heaven.   56 virgins?? What kind of god is that?  I would trade 56 virgins for one Bangkok prostitute any day of the week.
Both Assange and I are fighting extradition to the US.  Assange has been virtually silenced by the authorities. Few of his words reach the public ear.  I will fight tooth and nail to ensure my words will continue to flow.
Any media outlet that would like to interview me - question and answer style through email (prison phone interviews are not allowed) - contact my wife at mrsjanicemcafee@gmail.com.
"I have returned to controlling the $GHOST development.   My feud with management has ended.   With the announcement that we will soon release a private stable coin, will mark a new era in transacting crypto business.   Transaction fees will be shared amongst all $GHOST holders."
"From the prison yard I watched a jumbo jet fly over.   300 people crammed shoulder to shoulder.  I would rather be here, entertained by the threats screamed amongst rival gangs.  Things like ""I will rip off your head and shit down your neck"".  Can't wait to watch that one."
My cell mate is a Pakistani Muslim - a drug dealer.   He said we are in prison because God is angry with us.  That certainly explains much of my life.
"In prison I am surrounded by murderers, muggers and thieves.   Not as bad as our government of course.  But still ..."
"Be a free thinker,   But not a free speaker.  Authorities nowadays resent that."
"I am charged with tax fraud - which is lying on your tax return.   But I have filed no returns for many years and have made no secret of it.  If I have said nothing, how could I have lied?  My real crime is speaking publicly about the insanity rampant within our government."
"The prosecutors have called me a dangerous man.   If illuminating the corruption, hypocrisy and self-serving of our leaders  And suggesting that our government has become obscene, is dangerous  Then indeed, I am a dangerous man."
"I am content in here. I have friends.  The food is good. All is well.   Know that if I hang myself, a la Epstein, it will be no fault of mine."
"I miss only one thing in prison,   My wife @theemrsmcafee.  She has been my inspiration, my muse, my friend, my confidante and my lover.  She encourages and supports me.  But more than anything, she is my reason for living."
Who lost the debate?
The debates ...  Can we get to political cage fighting already?
The government treats the general public like idiots ...  Because the public are idiots.
"My friend Vanya, one of the great Ukranian sculptors,  made this as a gift.  I will place it on the entrance to my Minsk hideaway."
"My autobiography is coming out next year.  Here is a teaser chapter for free - ""The Woman in Nepal""."
Gentlemen: this just arrived on the scene.  Could be serious competition.  Just a heads up.
Went to Spain this weekend to  check the progress of the Mud Wrestling Arena I'm building.

Men:  We all know the problem that crops up when a woman sits on your face.  Can't breathe through your mouth cause it's busy. Can't breathe through your nose cause it's jammed against something else.  Will someone please invent a nose snorkel?  I'll be your first customer.

"Chinese spyware doesn't threaten you as an individual.  It's Google, Facebook etc. that do that.  Chinese spyware threatens the government, which, if you ask me, is in dire need of threatening."
"TikTok - Chinese Spyware????  LMFAO!  Compared to Google, TikTok is deaf and blind."
Yes. I now have a TikTok account - created the same day the U.S. banned it.
Not long ago I lost my pet Gerbil - Pete.  At a fetish club in Iceland.  We had partied together for years.  He was never found.  Here is my sad composition for my lost buddy.

I'm a sport pilot. It's a risky pastime. I've had a few close calls.
How to smoke a Cuban Cigar
"What is America?  A home? A culture, a society? Your stomping grounds? Is it the natural beauty - the seas, canyons, mountains, forests? Is it shared hopes, dreams, loves and beliefs?  All of these.  America resides in your heart.  It was once also the heart of our government."
The sound of music.  As I hear the music of the world around me today.
The table drum
"The Deep Web and Dark Web are 99.8% of the Web, yet less than 1% of you can see them.  The Dark Web, for ex, is disallowed data: secrets, drugs, assassins for sale, surveillance footage etc. It can't be seen by ordinary folks -  only those with special tools.  Learn and expand."
Our education system does not teach how to think.  It teaches only what to think.
"How has Twitter not banned my account? And why are posts like my ""smoke"" video (below) not taken down?  Simple.  I post only when the Twitter censors are on break for prayer. When they return they are blinded by Divine radiance for a while:)"
"A friend told me about Pornhub.  Free porn.  No ... seriously!!!  Searched ""Eskimo Kink"" (always had a fascination)  Don't ever do that!!"
"Since Coronavirus began, it has killed 960,000 Worldwide.  That's one person in 8,000.  Diarrhea has killed 3 times as many in the same period of time.  You can easily Google these numbers."
And the band played on.  Russians partying in Spain on my birthday:)
My new IG-Gram account:
"Is it ridiculous to believe that powerful people conspire to kidnap children and have blood ""rituals""?  *NEWS FLASH  Youthful blood reverses aging!!  Why is it unthinkable that rich, powerful, old people might want that blood?"
Damn!
That you all for your birthday wishes.  And hello from Spain.
"My execitive assistants:  L to R: Jane Smith, @theemrsmcafee and Anne Smith"
"Anne Smith, one of my Russian executive assistants, has started an I-gram page for me.  She would like to say hi:)"
"Today is my birthday.  75 years of a roller coaster ride between Heaven and Hell ...  Constantly passing ""normal"" as a speeding train might pass an intersection.  I would have it no other way."
"Masks are excellent at stopping bacteria.  But, trying to stop a virus with them is like trying to catch a fly with a wire fence."
I post an anti-mask tweet and an anti Bill Gates tweet and suddenly I'm a conspiracy theorist?  The only conspiricy I see is the conspiricy of the sheep to follow each other.

Now that I've lost the Libertarian primary ...   Anyone wanna buy five heavily armored SUV's?  No room for them in my retirement home:)
"I created a TikTok version of my now infamous ""Smoke"" video.  They deleted my account.  Here it is for as long as Twitter keeps it up:"
Welcome to this world.
"I get constant flack about my attitude toward trans-women.  I am not promoting trans-women - or any gender orientation.  But ...  If a person believes they are a woman, then they are a f*cking woman.  They live in their shoes. I do not.  Which of us would know better?"
"Who am I voting for?  No-one.  Why would I choose one person over another to control me?  Slave masters are the same.  We are numbers rather than people, irrespective of the master."
My estranged granddaughter.
Social Media Censorship ...  We do not pay for Social Media. We are not their customers.  We are their product.  Advertisers are their customers. It is the advertisers that must be pleased.  How long before advertisers become the censors?
"What is the purpose of Propaganda and Media Manipulation?  It is to change what we do, how we think, and who we are - so that we move in the chosen direction.  Is that happening today?"
"You think you have seen ""Truth"" when you watch a video on Mainstream Media?  Truth of actions, words, events, personalities, intentions?  NO!  Clever editing tells any story that the editor wants to tell.  Let me give you an example that will fool 95% of you."
"There are many reasons, besides CV, to fear other people - evil deeds abound in this world.   Fortunately, facial expressions betray most evil doers - we learn to recognize their intents.  Unfortunately,  masks hide those intents, especially from children.  Something to consider."
"First Court Case to Challenge Masks!  Tulsa Doctors sue to abandon masks.  They allege masks don't help the wearer or others, and they cause O2 deficiency, harming health.  They claim irrefutable evidence.  The Court's decision in this matter will have far reaching implications."
"The Media is an intermediary between you and reality - the happenings in the world you  cannot see with your own eyes.  You have little other access to ""Truth"".  If the Media is corrupt, then your knowledge of the world is corrupted  - making you a tool of someone else's purpose."
"Herd immunity is math, not medicine.  By doing nothing at the beginning, letting the virus free, the deaths front load and diminish quickly to next to nothing.   By isolating the population, the deaths drag out and are, in the end, more.  L - Sweden R - U.S.  Sweden was right."
Sweden refused to lock down.  Refused social distancing.  Refused to require masks.  For a while Sweden's death rate was high.  Now it's  nearly non-existent and by the end of the year their total death rate will be the lowest in the world.   They were right.  We were idiots.
Don't know which authority to trust about masks?  Breathe freely for a minute.  Observe.  Now put on a mask and breathe.  Feel the difference?  What you are feeling is your own exhalation and re-breathing it.  Do you need any more proof?  Trust yourself.  F*ck authority!
"Spanish police attempt to arrest a woman not wearing a mask.  Bystanders pull the woman away from the police and chase the police away, while chanting ""Liberty!""  Expect more of this, around the world, in the days to come."
"To clarify my tweets about @elonmusk's upcoming revolutionary announcement:  He will say:  - No axles - No frames - All critical moving parts -- power, brakes, steering and suspension are embedded in each wheel system - all else -- electric impulses.  How?  He will explain."
".@elonmusk signaled a ""Revolution in the way cars are made"".  Will unveil on Battery Day.  I'm impatient. Can't wait. I will announce it now.  Tesla will manufacture cars without axles and without frames.  ""How?"" You say.  I don't want to steal all his thunder.  He will explain:)"
"Even the ""Right"" are now saying: ""All have the right to own a gun except those without a Mental Health Certificate"".  I strongly disagree.  Who issues these certificates? What standards are used for determining mental health?  In our past, believing the Earth was round was insane"
"The 5 new commandments:  1. Thou shalt not believe the MSM  2. Thou shalt shun authority - for authority is no God.  3. Thou shalt not take sides in politics, for such is divisiveness.  4. Thou shat not believe Social media to be reality  5. Thou shalt discover thy true self."
It's now clear that farts transmit CV (Google it).  The Chinese claim that pants will stop the virus (   Ridiculous!  Pants stop the virus no more than masks do.  But I have created an N95 butt plug that releases the gas but stops the virus.  Available now

Do only what you love  Or your life will be a shell ...  Full of unfulfillment.
"When we tire of adhering to Covid restrictions, what will be next?  I don't think they will invent a new virus. We would all get suspicious.  I think it will be labeled: Covid-Wave2, or something similar.  Covid-Wave2 seems the likely candidate.  Wait for it:)"
"In America, only 6% of deaths reported as caused by Coronavirus were actually caused by Coronavirus (CDC report).  The rest were from other causes where the patient happened to be infected (Few of the infected have any symptoms)  Tell me this is all not a political power grab!"
"If Hollywoid could only get its act together:  First, Johnny Depp is Playing me in ""King of the Jungle"". Then Michael Keaton. Then Seth Rogan. Finally - Zac Effron.  Has everyone gone insane???   Danny DeVito is the only person who could possibly play me:)"

"Men ...  I now understand masks!  Though they limit breathing and will likely shorten our lives to no more than the average doctor, they have THIS advantage:  After rebreathing our stale, damp, dense air all day, when we finally take them off and our bitch sits on our face - WOW!"
How to be free
A peaceful evening
Something for the politicians who destroyed our economy to consider:  People condemned to poverty become restless.
Defi is the future. Obviously.  Here is a fascinating take on it:
What dick is harder than life?
"11 National food Chains and 25 retail chains, including GNC, JCPenny, Neiman Marcus, Pier1 etc, have gone bankrupt since May and will disappear.  The Coronavirus did not shut these icons down. Our Government's reaction to it did!  Remember this in November."
A horse could fix a merry go round  Before our politicians could fix the problems they've created.
Do masks protect against bacteria?  Absolutely!!!  Do they protect against viruses?  Im-fucking-possible!  Not even protecting others.  Every branch of science affirms this impossibility.  WTF people????
I saw a man in a car - solo - wearing a mask.  Why did no-one tell me we could infect ourselves?
We know masks don't protect us.  We wear them to protect others.  Are you f^cking serious?  The masks can't stop viruses.  Coughs?  The water droplets are so tiny they evaporate in a fraction of a second.  Virus released.  Use a hanky when you sneeze.  Have we become idiots?
"Getting flack cause I said: ""Masks Restrict Breathing"".  People!!  In every country in the world -- if you have ashma or any breathing disorder you are not required to wear a mask.  Why the f&amp;ck do you think that is??  Put one on. Breathe.  If you can't feel the impairment then.."

20% of Millenials who left home in the past year have returned home. 40% can't find jobs in their chosen field. 30% can't find jobs at all.  Your degrees are worth less than the paper they're printed on and your futures look as bleak as a George Romero Zombie film.  My advice:
"Getting flack over my soft porn/golden shower videos.  The election is coming. My tweets will get 10 times worse.  Political discourse soon - In my way.  If it bothers you, block, or mute me, til December - or forever - your choice.  'Cause you aint seen nothin' yet."

"My suggestion that we don't kill cows but instead eat only their legs was ill received.  We wouldn't leave them helpless on the ground FFS!  We'd have ""carts"" for their torsos - pushed around by cheap Mexican labor, so the cows stay active and content.  I'm not a fucking monster!"

After my arrest in Germany we went to Belarus. But the mountains were too cold.   We returned to Catalonia for one day - on our way to Tangiers.  We let all our pent-up frustration out in a celebration of living:
How propaganda works ...  And a topical example.
"Despite my efforts (licking handles of grocery carts, bottom of my shoes, etc.) I'm unable to get Coronavirus to challenge me.  Testing continually shows a valid test (Control line) and neither active antibodies (M) nor past infection (G).  Maybe 'cause the WHO stats are correct."

Celebrating my release from jail with my executive assistants.  Seen here: Jane Smith.
"The MSM fact checks stories?  Nope!  Though the police uniforms in the photos clearly showed ""Polizei"" (German, not Norwegian - therefore Germany, Switzerland, Bavaria or Austria), many news outlets reported ""Norway"" as the location of my arrest.  Just 'cause I said so.  Wow!"
I was jailed: Why? Visited Catalonia just before Europe banned Catalonians from travelling.  Tried to return to Germany and were refused entrance. They demanded we wear masks.   I put on my thong mask.   They demanded I replace it. I refused.  Tussle. Jail. Black eye.  Released.
"I'm back in Belarus and, with the exception of a black eye, no worse for wear.  I cannot speak publicly about my fun and games yesterday, regrettably, but after a few hours sleep I will be back with my usual stream of conscious:)  Good to be back."

"Ok, Ok.  Yes, coronavirus, although large for a virus, is still 2,000 times smaller than a large bacteria, which masks do stop.  And yes, I know viruses in droplets are released when the droplets evaporate.  Duh!!  But ...  I have breathed through this mask.  What could survive?"
"People say my masks don't work for Coronavirus.  Bullshit!!  It's true that Doctors wear masks only to deter bacterial infection (viruses are 1,000 times smaller than bacteria and masks can't help),  But I have breathed through my masks.  Nothing can therefore survive passage:)"

Dinner in Spain this past weekend.  Lady in foreground:  My Russian Executive Assistant: Jane Smith.
"I just debunked speculation that the firearm shown next to Jake Paul's hottub was a sniper rifle (was an air rifle).  Ton's of responses like:  ""So what do you know about guns Mr. McAfee? You're a tech geek!"".  Please!!!!!!    @LoganPaul"
Would you buy a safe from a company that could not crack safes?  No.  I founded the Word's largest Computer Security Company because I could bypass any security in the world.  Never manipulated.  Merely wanted to know.  And I know.  People ...  Wake up.
"Jake Paul:  If anyone knows firearms it's me (Google me) and, in the only clear gun photo, this is not a firearm. It's a Gammo Whisper AIR RIFLE.  Legal in every state in the Union  #Jakepaul is simply one more person with influence speaking out against the rising Police State."

"People seem to be having trouble with basic math, so let me put it simply:  The more we test, obviously, the more cases we will find.  So ...  The increased number of cases that we are finding through our incresed testing, does not, in any way, mean that the virus is worsening."
"Covid ""CASES"" increasing?  Of course!  Less than 1% of the population has been tested.  The more tests, the more cases.  ""Daily Deaths"" are the only true measure of its impact.  It has been constant at less than 5,000 per day, worldwide, since May 21st - less than 1 in a million."

"I get a kick out of people's comments like:  ""I know where you are. I saw you and Janice in London (or Paris, or Cambrils, or Mazatlan ...)"".  I have 7 body doubles. Janice has six."

I was hoping to be the first person to get a $GHOST coin tattoo but @petmalulodi078 beat me to it.  So I got my own stylized version today:)
Would it not be worthwhile to find out which politicians received campaign funds from police unions?  Just saying.
Police Brutality:  It's not the police themselves as much as the police unions - which contribute to local and state political campaigns and support their members irrespective of behavior.  They are more concerned with sustaining the union than with promoting public safety.

Protests against police brutality are being met with a wave of police brutality across the U.S.  Our Authorities have gone insane.  Is it not time to vote EVERYONE out?
"People asked why I didn't just bribe the police in Mexico.  Yes, of course that's a possibility.  I just preferred jail. More fun.  But the Police in America, in my experience, are the easiest to bribe in the world. There are no exceptions.  They just cost more."
"I know more about police than almost anyone on earth.  Been arrested 21 times in 11 different countries - all for non-violent crimes.  If you give someone authority over another person ... arrogance is the natural result.  Shakespeare called it ...  ""The insolence of office""."
Our problem is deeper than Authority's racial disrespect.  It's Authority's disrespect for all the people it governs.  You cannot remove our constitutional right to assemble then beat us with batons when we refuse to disperse.  And ...  Then demand that we respect Authourity.
"Is this how to calm an angry and frustrated population?  No, I did not see what came before, and if I had ... I would not have seen what came before that ... and before that ...  We must stop that nonsensical argument.   Every cause is an effect of a prior cause. Wake up!"

Drugs 101.  Initial episode.
"You ask: What's the best drug?  For what?  Introspection? Sex? Conversation? Studying? Perception? Laughter? Depth?  I only know that the old drugs (Pre-Chinese development), like Cocaine, Meth, LSD, etc., have been lost in the dust.  MDPV, a-php, C2-E, etc. Have replaced them."

"The Lockdown left 40 million unemployed, forced businesses to the brink of bankruptcy and caused bitterness, frustration and anger - and now rioting.  The Coronavirus was a blip compared to this mess.  We must address the insanity within our government that began this."

We live in a soup of viruses - 800 million per square meter of air.  Covid-19 is airborne. It travels 100's of miles on the wind.  Social distancing and lockdown are the most idiotic laws ever enacted.  Next election -- you will know who the idiots are.  Vote them out.
"Almost all CV deaths were elderly or critically ill - those who had lived a long life, or those who were children of misfortune.  For many, each new day was a lucky day.  Along comes a cold, or the flu or Covid-19.  Can we blame these exit attendants of life, for their deaths?"

"Our privacy is nearly gone.  No-one knows this better than me ...  Except the ""Authorities""  Whom we damn well better start fearing."
"There is no way, under any circumstance, to communicate electronically and ensure that your communication is not being read/heard by Agencies of Developed Countries.  The only thing you can now hide is your location, and that privacy will soon also evaporate.  If we do nothing."
"The average head circumference of newborns is decreasing.  Since our smart phones do most of our thinking for us, the brain will soon become as useful as nipples on men.  Probably be a good thing.  Considering the devastation and chaos wrought upon this planet by our brains."
"You asked about diet:  *NO PROCESSED MEATS*  No dairy, breads, cereals  Limit grain foods  Eat - Kale, berries, cabbage, artichokes, avacodos, red peppers, nuts, tomatos, shrooms, kumquats  Lean steak (2×/week) Fish One egg per day Multi-vitamin supplement And .... NAC is a MUST!"
Breakfast at my favorite Mexican/Bavarian-Thai restaurant in Moscow.
"I'm 74. How do I survive 2 quarts of whiskey and 3 packs of unfiltered cigarettes every day?  Because I also take 3,000 mg of N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine, inject 5,000 mcg. of Cyanicobalamin and take massive amounts of milk thistle extract, magnesium, calcium and thiamine daily.  Simple."
"Daily deaths from Covid-19 dropped to 1,179.  That's 1 death per 5 million population.   About the same as the number of people who die from falling from ladders each day.  1/5th as many as those who die from diarrhea each day.  It is a non-event, no matter how you slice it."

"I predicted that by May 21st, the daily deaths, Worldwide, from CV, as counted by the World Health Organization, would diminish to less than one in a million.  On May 21st, the number of daily deaths reached less than 5,000, out of 7.8 billion people.  Less than one in a million."

People saying my street cred is non-existent.  Really ...?  I've been imprisoned in 11 countries.  If that's not cred what is?
Can I count the two months I spent in Lockdown as jail time?  It would give me greater street cred.
"Is there hope, they ask?  Hope for what?  A better life? More drugs? Less taxes? More self awareness? A Government that cares? Lower taxes? Better jobs? More sex? A loving God? Someone who is interested in US? Forgiveness?  I only know this:  There is hope for one of the above."
There is a difference between knowing the Truth and speaking the Truth.  The first is a great advantage.  The second is a grave danger.
"Why don't we all tell the truth?  Honesty, sadly, is not supportive of evolution.  Look at flowers that mimic insects to aid pollination.  Leopards that look like fields of weeds.  Fish that have appendages that look like lures.  Truth is in not life supporting.  Deception is."
"People -- Tentative, apprehensive ...   Behind their masks and distances ...  Emerge Into a new World."

"Sadly ... women first want to fuck you,  Then they want to fuck you over."
Claiming a procuct is open source while witholding the documention is fraud. Pure and simple. I will soon demonstrate that in the courts.  Lawsuit coming for defamation.
"My final tweet in the $GHOST controversy:  PIVX is attempting to claim that their source code is Public Domain, but that the description of how it all works (The White Paper) is not!  Then what f*cking good is Open Source if the documentation is not included?  What scam is this?"
"Crypto growth frequently is based on forking blockchains.  PIVX is open source - no one owns it.  We took the PIVX blockchain and forked it to create $GHOST.  We changed much, but why re-write those functions of the blockchain which we did not change?  How can that be plagiarism?"
"The $GHOST controversy is storm in a teacup.  Forking an existing blockchain is a common occurrence, ex: Bitcoin to BTC, etc.  The developers of the original blockchain always kick up a fuss. It's the way of the world.  This is a triviality folks. Get over it."

I miss presidents that lie in complete sentences.
"Was celebrating the end of lockdown when Kim bursts in and demands 10,000 units of my anti-virus.  He looked sick to me."
Ventilators  No studies showing that these machines save 1 out of 10 people rather than kill 9 out of 10.  All you have is the assumption that they save one out of ten ...  ... And the fact that 9 out of 10 die.  Assumptions vs facts.  What's happened to science my friends?
Respirators  9 of 10 placed on them die.  We assume they will all die without them.  Based on what data? None.  Many infected have blood oxygen levels so low they should be dead but show no symptoms and recover with no treatment.  We are killing through a self fulfilling prophecy
"They say: I don't clean up,  I gonna die ...  56 years I smoke 3 packs of cigs a day.  I down, at least, two quarts of Whiskey a day for 52 years ...  And take every drug known to man in quantities larger than you can carry -  And Smack is still my favorite ..  So when Mofo's???"

"We are exchanging human life for $39,000 per soul.  $39,000 that our Government gives to hospitals, per patient, provided only that the hospitals are willing to put patients on a respirator.  No respirator - no $39,000.  These are dark days for America."
"says the U.S. and Western Europe are the top purchasers of re-usable respirators.  These countries also account for 70% of CV deaths. Countries like India, have few respirators per population and far fewer deaths.  80% to 90% of respirator victims die. ???"

"Commentors said:  ""Landlords should get real jobs"".  Horrifying!  Most landlords are individuals who own a duplex, a house, or small apartment. Virtually all of them have full time jobs.   They work their asses off.  Their mortgages provide a place for renters to live.  WAKE UP!"
"The ""emergency"" laws recently enacted by State and local Govt's are simply Communism.  The most astonishing are laws saying tenants don't have to to pay rent.  What about Landlords who must pay mortgages or lose their buildings?  Getting weird folks."
"Does anyone else see the insanity of virtually all of crypto being tied to the value of Bitcoin?  Why for example, should Monero, whose value is its Privacy, be tied in any way to a coin that has ZERO privacy -- Bitcoin?"

"Sorry to be spamming you with useless numbers, But ...  Here's another piece of useless trivia:  The six most seriously locked down countries:  U.S. U.K. Italy Spain France Germany  Account for 4% of World population,  Yet 71% of Worldwide CV deaths.  No idea what thatt means:)"
"Oops ... sorry ... 100 times greater. Not 200.   100 times greater than the average of the world's ten largest countries.  It's still an outright, unarguable impossibility."
"NYC has a CV death rate 200 times higher than the average of the World's ten largest Cities,  Cities like Tokyo - where they cram people into subway cars, and never locked down!  Impossible!!!  Source:   and    Do the math  @NYCMayor"
"They want @NYCMayor's head for ""inflating numbers"", which caused nationwide panic.  But he inflated nothing.  It was the hospitals in NYC who got $39,000 from the Government, simply for writing ""Covid-19"" as the diagnosis for an illness.  Who among you would not be tempted?"
"""But, how?"" You say.  Replace them with derelicts from the street. It could be no worse.  Or elect only those under thirty - too green to f*ck us over.  Political experience is a negative. The truly experienced have but one talent:  Lining their pockets at our expense."

"People are starting to blame Trump for this absurd shutdown.  He was forced to take action.  Who has benefitted most from the lockdown?   The Mainstream Media - his greatest enemy.  Since lockdown, all eyes are glued to the TV 24 hours a day.  The value of media is eyeballs×time."
"England has been on severe lockdown, yet half of the country may be infected.  The Japanese said: ""Lockdown is ridiculous"".  They did not lock down a country that literally ""jams"" people into subway cars  Yet, they have among the lowest death rates in the World.  People: Wake up!"
"An Oxford University study:     Mirrored Stanford's study:  Half of our population Is already infected, making lockdown the most ridiculous event of the past 200 years!  Except NYC, where hospitals are taking advantage of the $39,000 per diagnosed patient:)"
"If 1% of the Word's general population has been tested and a number - ""X"" were infected, then the likely REAL number of infections is 100 times X.  Death rate is is determined by dividing deaths by total infections.  Thus the death rate is 100 times less.  Math folks- help me out"
Authorities doubt studies showing Covid-19 has infected many more than the reported numbers from testing show - making its death rate less then the flu.  But the studies are correct.  Let's use math:  Fewer than 1% of the world population has been tested.  Extrapolate the numbers
Some will say:  The horror -- betting on human lives:  This is far more than betting on people's lives.  This is betting on the future of our World.
"To @BillGates:  I will bet you  $25,000  That by May 21st, the daily worldwide death rate from CV will be less than 5 deaths per million population, as measured by WHO.  Surely more die from heart attacks while having sex!!!  Will you take this bet?  If not,   SHAME on you!!!"

"Alright!!!  I will put up $25,000, immediately, in escrow, if any person on the planet, with name recognition, will bet me and do the same.  If not ...  You are all admitting that this ""Lockdown"" was totally unnecessary ...  And that we have all been bamboozled.  BET ME MOFOs!!!"
"No high profile dude or dudette is going to bet me???  I'm saying less than 5 people per fucking Million!!!!  For the worst Pandemic of our times???  I haven't checked, but surely more people die falling off of ladders!!!  Is my opposition among high profile people all cowards?"
"They say I'm an idiot for predicting that by May 21st, the daily Covid deaths, worldwide, as counted by WHO ...  Would be no greater than 5 deaths per million World population.  I'm looking for a HIGH PROFILE FOOL who will bet me $5,000 (In DAI)  So the world can watch.  Takers?"
"For arguments against it being seasonal:  I've had my say. I'll say no more.  If I'm right ... It, like the flu, will be all but gone --  (let's say ... less than 5 deaths daily, worldwide, per million population)  -- By the third week in May.  It's just 3 weeks away. Relax:)"
"You ask: What Can We Do?  The most powerful force for social change is your voice.   When spoken collectively, as one, it shakes the foundations of the old order.  Raise your voice, loud and clear -  In your Social Media,  At dinners, bars and work  --- Scream:  NO MORE!"
"More and more, people are letting someone, or some entity, think for them.   It stems, in part, from laziness,  And from fear of thinking incorrectly.  If they let ""Authority"" think for them, their thoughts will obviously be correct.  That's why they have the authority!!  DUH!!!"
My apologies ...  I was wrong about the 71 fatter. There only 11.  My apologies.  The 71 is the percentage of the world that did not lock down.

My heart goes out to non-native English language people in the world who struggle with the complexities of English.  Here is a prime example:
"Why is the U.S. death rate 7 times greater than the rest of the world?  (You don't need a source - calculate the published numbers).  Is it because U.S.Hospitals get $39,000 if they diagnose a patient with Covid-19?  Or is the U.S. just unlucky?  There are no other answers."
"To all the Karens out there:  What will you do when you discover,  As it is becoming increaingly clear,  That Covid-19 is less deadly than the flu?  You will have some huge apologies to make."

The main argument I'm getting against my prior three statistics tweets is --  We can't trust the sources of the data.  I ABSOLUTELY AGREE!!!  Yet ...  Those same numbers are being used by Governments as a rationale ...  For shutting down and destroying the economies of the world.
"The U.S. has a covid-19 death rate 7 times higher than the world average.  And NYC has a death rate 200 times higher than the world's 10 largest cities.  Could it be that the U.S. pays hospitals $39,000 for every patient diagnosed with Covid19?  Nah, forget it.  Couldn't be that."
"The world has a population of 7.8 billion. 200,000 have died from Coronavirus.  The U.S. has 328 million. 54,000 have died from Coronavirus.  That's 7 times the death rate of the rest of the world.  Odd ...  Considering that two thirds of the World was never even on lockdown."
Sources:     And      WHO
"The 10 largest cities (Tokyo, Dhaka, Mumbai, Cairo, mexico City, Dehli, Beijing, Sao Paulo, Osaka, Shanghai),  Have a combined population of 231M.  Their combined deaths from Coronavirus is 930.  NYC has 8M people.  And 11,000 deaths.  A death rate 200 times the average.  ???????"
"NYC has had 11,000 Covid deaths.  Tokyo, the World's largest and densest city, has had 93.  NYC is locked down.  Tokyo was never locked down.  Both have had the virus for the same amount of time.  Why is NYC's death rate 250 times higher than Tokyo's?  Something fishy here."

Pirate Parrot's main squeeze - Polly - is the brains of the outfit. We asked her for a detailed analysis of Bill Gates' proposal.  Here is her analyses:
"I'm losing faith in the human race.  I tweeted a photo of a poppy plant which uncannily resembled a vagina.  To me it was fascinating, as it was to most others.  A random woman, however, berated me viciously over the impropriety of it.  Wonder what she will think of this:"
"Forget Covid-19. The human race will self destruct from gullibility.   My previous tweet about Phuque University (Pronounced ""F*ck You"") under the direction of Dr. Ho Ha, was believed by 20% of commentors.  None of whom, thankfully, were among my followers.  We are doomed."
Poppies also have been spliced with human DNA as these two images suggest:
"A research lab at Phuque University in Vietnam, headed by Jyung Ho Ha, has spliced a soybean gene with genes from a Sheartailed Hummingbird.  The result is astonishing:"
"Looking for a caption.  Must be suitable for a right-wing, fundamental Christian publication -  To be used in a children's Bible study class."

"The federal government is sending everyone a $600 rebate.  If you boil down Marc Farber's analysis, this is how we should spend it:"
This will be everyone if Lockdown is not over soon: .
"In the 1950's the U.S. Government created the ""Cleanup Bureau"".  In 1959, the Bureau produced a video claiming that a ""neat and clean"" house would survive a nuclear explosion. I shit thee not.  Do any of you truly believe this same government is not still lying to us? ."
My daughter's boyfriend is afraid of guns.  I suggested they both see other men.
New evidence suggests that Covid-19 was the result of someone in China having sex with flowers.
"This was sent to me by a follower:  Don't know how real this is,  But it mirrors everything I've been saying about Covid-19.  Why wear the mask?  Because in this political/social envinment of fear, created by the MSM, he would ostracized and certainly fired."

"Before everybody jumps down my throat ...  Sweden's death count is equivalent to one death per every 10,000 people.  Who in their right mind would shut down a country.. Based on such ridiculously low numbers?  Especially when Corovirus is nearing the end of its season."
"I'm getting trashed because I insist that, in the Northern Hemisphere ...  Covid-19 will be a virtual non event by mid-May ...  Even in Countries like Sweden which are not on lockdown.  Ok then ...  It's only a month away.  I will bet any and all  $1,000  That I'm right."
"Trump said ""Sweden is suffering badly - they're not in lockdown"".  Bullshit ...  Sweden has 1,000 deaths since this began.  A lot?  The flu killed six times as many in the same time period.  Thank you Sweden.  When the virus disappears in May,  Sweden will fare better than any."

"Since the outbreak began, China has had less than 4,000 deaths.  That's one death per half a million people in China.  The flu has killed 200,000 people in China in the same amount of time.  Isn't it odd that China raised the Covid-19 alarm in the first place?"

I an effort to make myself even more unpopular than I am ...  Regarding my Cov8d-19 views ...  I would like to push myself off the edge with this video:
"Covid-19 deaths in the U.S. topped 1,800 yesterday.  Total deaths Worldwide were 3,800.  The U S. Is accounting for almost 50% of World wide deaths now.  Yet the the U.S. population is approximately 5% of the World population.  What is the U.S. doing wrong?"
"Privacy coins and distributed exchanges will soon be outlawed.  But these laws will have no more teeth than the ineffective laws against Marijuana.  Do not abdicate your rights!  You have, absolutely, the right to financial privacy.  Ignore unconstitutional laws."

"China lifts lockdown.  The first country to do so.  China is back in business, While the rest of the World is in chaos.  If Covid-19 has winners and losers ...  China just won."
Pirate Parrot and I enduring lickdown.
"Berfore Covid-19 ...  Our World Economy  Was teetering on the verge of collapse ..  Because of corrupt, inept leadership.  But ... miracolously,  Covid-19 happened,  And IT is now responsible for the economic chaos ..  Created by our leaders' responses to it.  Fortunate for them!"

"World Governments are panicked about Coronavirus hospitalizations ...  ""Services will be overrun""  They say.  Yet, Coronavirus hospitaluzations are fewer than 50,000 patients.  The Flu accounts for 3 million hospitalizations per year.  Wake up people.  You are being manipulated."
The Covid-19 deaths are tragic.  But 500 times as many people died from diarrhea -  And 20 times as many have died from the flu -  In the same 5 months that Covid-19 Has been with us.  Even if it gets 100 times worse ...  It is but a blip On the scale Of global health problems
"In America, Three out of every million people have died ...  From Covid-19  And the Government and the media -  Fearing what MIGHT happen Call this a catastrophe.  In the same period that Coronavirus has existed ...  116  out of one million ...  Died from the flu.  Wake up."
U.S. passes $2.2 Trillion Covid-19 bill ...  Costing 10% of the U S. Gross National Product ...  For a virus that has killed three people for every million citizens of the U.S.  And in China -  Where all this began -  They no longer ...  Seemingly ...  Have a problem.  Wake up.
My response to @VerminSupreme and his use of time travel to manipulate the Libertarian Nomination process.  I personally feel that his frequent trips into the future give him unfair advantage.
"Don't mean to harp on Corona ... But ...  It's killed fewer than 100,000 in the five months it's been with us.  In that same period ...  Diarrhea has kilked 1.1 million.  Should we not be better off ...  By closing only the Mexican restaurants ...  Rather than every business? ."
"Who are the beneficiaries Of Quarantine?  - pharmacies - hospitals - supermarkets  -- (The only businesses allowed to open in fully locked-down countries)  Thank God this has nothing to do with Big-Pharma, Monsanto, or other megalomaniacal Corporation ..."
The universal Coronavirus  Quandary:
I can only do 2 hours Of news Each week.  I am dumb enough As it is.
"Been watching news of Corona from RT, Al Jazeera and everyone.  The net net:  We've elected idiots for World leaders.  Charismatic, yes, and talented in two areas:  1. Convincing us they can help. 2. The science of serving themselves.  But idiots none the less!"
"My Honoray Doctorate, From Roanoke College, Says simply:  ""Doctor of Science"".  Doesn't say which Science.  I've always assumed it was ...  The Science of Misconduct."
The clouds still whisp Across the sky.  Birds fly And squirrels play.  It's as if the disappearance Of Humans - Quarantined From the world Outside of houses ...  Matters not At all To the World.
Been told By more than one Doctor ...  If I don't stop:  - smoking 3 packs of cigarettes a day -drinking 2 quarts of booze a day - taking every drug offered me ...  That I won't need to worry about buying Christmas presents this year.  But ...  I'm 74. And I like me like this.
So if this is true ...  Why do we need to pay taxes?  The Fed could just print what we all owe ... And give it to the IRS.  See .. people ...  All of our problems could have been solved.  - The National Debt - World Hunger - A Lambo for all  Why did no-one tell me this before??
The Fed --  In order to calm fears of the financial aftermath Of lockdown Said:  Don't worry ... We have an infinite amount of money.  Wow!!   Let's just print it then!! Excellent idea!!  Why should people have to work??  Clearly ... My Economics knowledge  Needs updating.
"Less than half a million have died from Corona!!!  It is a statistical insignificance.  630,000 people have died from the flu since Corona has been with us.  Why don't we lock ourselves in because if the flu?????  Wouldn't that make more sense?  Please ...  People!!!"
"89% of 12,000 people polled Said:  ""I do not trust my Government""  Yet ..  When your government took away your Civil Liberties  And gave As an excuse --  Numbers and statistics controlled by your Government  ...  You, unquestioning. Went home  And locked yourself in.  Seriously??"
My conversation  With a parrot  Regarding the State of the World.
In a world with a functioning economy ...  9 million people die each year from starvation.  Imagine the impact on the World Economy Of the lockdowns we are creating.  We are guaranteeing the starvatiin of hundreds of millions of people ...  So we can all feel safe  From a virus.

Freedom  After Martial Law ---
No video or photos were allowed by those who assisted our escape from Spain.  However ... Tomorrow ...  (I have to wait 24 hours after I leave a place before I can show myself in a recognizable location)  I will post pictures of Janice and I back in the Country of our residence:)
We're close to settling back in. Will post photos soon.  Again:  I love Spain and its people.  I'm sorry our last encounter was tense.  But I did obey your laws:)  In spite of our differences.  This will all be over soon ...  And we can visit again under better circumstances.
"We have escaped from Spain.  No harm done. On either side I hope.  I love Spain With all my heart.  My Campaign staff produced this video, In honor of our time in Spain.  Knowing @Loggiaonfire And the rest --  They stole it from someone.  My apologies to whomever that is."
My last post For a while.  Taking off.  Enjoying every moment.
We are on a private plane ... Leaving Spain ... And Martial-LawLand.  Going dark for a while.
"Diarhea kills 2,000 children a day a day.  Just the children.  Coronavirus has killed 8,000 people Worldwide, In five months.  Use your heads people.  You are in a war.  And not with a virus. . . You want to stop killing 2,000 children a day ...  End greed in the U.S. Government."
"Lower Respiratory Infections (Coronaviris is one), account for over 3 million deaths per year  Diarrhea accounts for over 1 million.  Coronary artery disease accounts for almost 10 million deaths.  In the 5 months that Coronavirus has been with us  It has killed less than 10,000"
"And if someone says:  ""Tell that to the 20,000 people who have died,:  I will vomit.  Why not tell something to the 600,000 people who have died from the flu in the same period.  Or the 1.5 million who have died from diarrhea  in the same period.  Wake up people!!!"
"I am in the highest risk group for the Coronavirus.  I am 74.  If I believed, Even remotely, (And I have seen every statistic from the WHO, the CDC, Johns Hopkins, and others)  That the Coronavirus was a threat,  I would be concerned.  But it is not.  Stop buying the MSM's story."
"""Aren't I afraid, going outside? We are safe in here.""  No one is ever safe.  Fear caused this entire country to accept: - no travel - no open businesses - no contacts with neighbors, friends - no approaching anyone closer than 3 feet - no standing outside feeling the sun  Sane?"
Oh ... Can't touch anybody either.
"I did, unintentionally, break the law today:  Was in the food place, Talking quietly with my driver.  Two security personnel approached And said we had  Violated The three foot law. (You can't be within three feet of any other person).  I apologized in my broken Spanish.  Was OK"
I break no law Here in Martial LawLand.   - one person per car - I can't drive. I need a driver.   -- Authorities agreed.  - Essential travel for food/medical only. I have no refrigerator (True). Need fresh food each day. -- Agreed  Medical every day? I'm 74. Got problems Agreed
"I apologize to Congressman @RepBobbyRush For offending you to the point That you filed a complaint with Twitter About one of my tweets being racist.  That was not my intent.  I believe I am not racist. Ex: To the best of my knowledge, My wife @theemrsmcafee is black.  I am sorry."
"We are in ""Mandatory Quarantine"" In this country --  An emergency law Preventing any citizen From meeting with any other citizen ...  Without permission.  This has never, In History,  Without aggression,  Been done before.  Shame on you ... My children."
So here's a mind numbing question:  What's happening  Now  For those who were with their lovers Instead of their spouses When martial law was imposed?  The things we never consider When choosing a new path.
I think it's time for this ...  How many of you truly Trust your Government -  The politicians who have all the power?  So tell me ...  Do you trust your Government?
I am chastised for not listening to Government's decisions And advice.   But I ask you:  When was the last time you benefitted  From listening to your Government?  Eh? :)
"""The sick will overwhelm our hospitals""  Our leaders scream.  I am in the hardest hit country in Europe - Suffering the most Draconian effects Of Martial Law ...  And this is the second largest hospital.  No lines No chaos No crowded waiting room No panic ...  Wake up people!"
Martial Law In Spain Was so sudden and dramatic ...  That businesses had no time to do an orderly shutdown.  Here a chalkboard sign - taken in every night -  Was left where it has stood for 5 days.  No-one is outside ... So no-one can steal it:)  Or even move it.  Or even see it.
Hopefully we will be out of Spain and back in a Sane country --  One That's entirely ignoring Coronavirus ... (Sweden plus 161 other countries)  As they should. As everyone should.  Politicians in countries that implemented lockdown Should be charged with Crimes against humanity.
"Stopped by police today For having more than one person in the car.  The lockdown makes it illegal to have more than just the driver.  Explained that I was an old man who can't drive But I needed groceries.  Had purchased booze, olive oil and herbs.  We were legal:)"
Karma is coming for you toilet paper Barons:)
Food will soon be a serious problem.  I've been watching supplies in supermarkets.  It's getting spooky.  What's happening here Will soon be happening in all countries That have implemented Containment measures against Corona.  Get yourself to a country that's ignoring this.
"We are still unable to get out of Spain in order to go home.  Nothing open except hospitals and supermarkets. No banks No hotels No restaurants, bars, clubs, Nothing. Can't get money Can't cash checks ... Nothing"
"In 5 months  The Coronavirus has killed 7,000 people Word-wide Out of 5 Billion people.  That's 46 people a day. Worldwide.  The flu kills 1,800 people a day.  Why are we not locking down for the flu every year??  See the idiocy people."

We drove South from Barcelona to see what   Opportunities ...  May have opened up in smaller cities - Due to the newly imposed martial law ...  And a fear crazed populace.  Here's an image for you:
"The bathroom problem is easily solved.  Not even the local authorities can be seen anywhere,   Let alone - citizens.  Nor any authorities whatsoever ... Which is odd.  So I felt free to urinate just anywhere:)  I chose a spot next to a locked down McDonalds:)"
Life under Martial Law in Spain.  Worse thing is trying to find a bathroom:)
People Helping others Is what I'm seeing now.  But soon ...  People will not be able Even To help themselves.  Then what?
And here's the weirdest thing ...  Toilet paper evaporated a week ago. But it suddenly returned by the truckload...  Just as the frozen fish disappeared:)
Water is disappearing from stores and supermarkets and fresh vegetables are scarce.  Quite an adventure we're having.
The streets are empty. Police tape around every park And playground.  No children laughing. No conversations. No barking dogs. No traffic. No people.  It is an Apocalypse Of the mind.  These pics were a risk.  Hard to explain why I'm hanging around A playground under lockdown:)
"Been recording this shit going down ... Under Martial law ... Starting A few days ago.  Rice, noodles, potatoes, etc. Went first.  This poor bag of macaroni Sitting so forlorn, Wanted by no-one ... --- I immediately sensed a trap And moved on:))"
I was visiting - The wrong friends ... At the wrong time.  And I'm now stuck in a location under total martial law.  My friend took a walk Alone On the beach early this morning  She was arrested And fined approximately$2000.  It is madness here.  I am starting a journal.
Part two of the second Coronavirus scenario.
Part one  Of my second plausible reality Of the Coronavirus:
I was locked out of Twitter Because:  I tweeted that Blacks could not get Coronavirus ...  It was a joke making fun of the anti-Chinese racial conflicts sweeping the world.  If Twittet thinks it was a racist statement against Blacks ...  This is my wife -- @theemrsmcafee   @jack
"100's of celebrities, public figures, and Politicians  Have Coronavirus.  But watch ...  Not one of them will develop Complications.  And, certainly, none will die.  Which is statistically impossible ...  If this is a deadly virus.  You can soon verify this With your own eyes."
An alarming confession about today.
"People say I'm an attention seeker.  No duh!  We live in an age where ""attention"" translates directly into money.  And I gotta live.  What idiot influencer -  (and please God I hope I influence no-one) -  Doesn't want more attention?  So ...  YES!!  Look at me everybody:)"
"""Thousands die Worldwide from Coronavirus.""  Absolutely!!!  Almost 10,000 people.  In a World of 5 billion.  Use your heads.  In the same time that Coronavirus has been with us ...  The Flu  Has killed over 600,000.  Don't buy into this nonsense.  This is orchestrated hysteria."
"Those orchestrating this game Need every nation to toe the line And implement restrictions.  Otherwise ...  They will not be able to say:  ""See .. We saved you"" When little or nothing happens.  If Sweden, and others, Ignore it And the virus is still a dud The orchestrators fail."
Sweden saw through the Coronavirus scare.  They refused to burden their citizens and their economy with restrictions - That cannot work.  It's an airborne virus people. Wind can carry sneeze droplets for miles.  My question:  Why does China care what Sweden does?  Think about it.
The vaccine debate:  Here is the issue:  Why do those who want vaccinations  Give a shit  About what those who don't want them Choose to do  Or not do?  If you're vaccinated you are safe from all ...  According to your own beliefs ...  So why concern yourself with what others do?
"So far: The risk of catching Coronavirus and dying from it ...  Is 100 times less Than catching the flu And dying from the flu.  I predict there will be fewer than 100,000 deaths worldwide from Corona.  Flu killed 3 quarters of a million in the past year alone.  Corona is a scam."
I know little of biological viruses.  But I know epidemiology Which studies the transmission vectors and other conditions governing the spread and damage Of viruses. (among others)  Why?  Because computer viruses obey the same transmission paradigms.  And I am God of that arena.
Why no Government Can function properly ...  Without a Department Of Anal fisting.
Just so we are clear:  I'm running ... For nomination As the Libertarian Presidential Candidate ...  And also for nomination as the Libertarian Vice Presidential candidate ...  And ...  For Chairman of the Libertarian Party.  Let's shake some shit up!!!  @LPNational
It's the fear of Coronavirus That is our threat.   Not the virus itself ...  Which will soon be revealed to be a  Dud.
The Libertarian Party Leadership -  Has turned their backs to me.  But I ask you ...  What idiots turn their backs to a man ...  Just waiting for them to turn their backs.
"I have avoided the Mainstream Media For 13 months.  Mostly because:  Not outlet had a reporter with the balls To submit to being strip searched, blindfolded, and driven for hours to an undisclosed location To interview me.  Except Germany's Focus Magazine.  Article coming shortly"
It's true:  I see things others do not.  But ...  I've always assumed That was the drugs.
Why I am running for President .  In spite of the impossibility of me ever becoming President:
"In a World gone mad, It is difficult to speak out And not appear crazy."
"My interview about the Coronavirus.  My ""Extreme"" views Laid out For all to see. :)"
You believe these Draconian measures Against Coronavirus Will have any effect?  Please!!! This is Human Arrogance In the extreme!  History has shown us:  No power or technology On Earth Can stop the invasion Of an enemy That cannot be seen.
"CORONAVIRUS CAN BE TRANSMITTED BY VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF KEYSTROKES.  True.  The vibratory pattern, when displayed on a screen, reacts with existing DNA on the screen and morphs into Corona.  Word!!  A dude saw this in an Opium dream, Whispered it to a dog,  Who then told me."
The Coronavirus response has become - By any definition of the word -  Insane.  And we voted these Fucks -  Who are now making decisions about our rights to assemble And move freely as we wish -  Into positions of power.  Surely we can vote them out!?
"A friend of one of my friend's friends,  Said ...  His cousin works at a Chinese Toilet paper manufacturer ... And he told him:  ""The Chinese are purposely spreading Coronavirus ..  Though toilet paper that has been sprayed with the virus Prior to packaging.  AVOID TOILET PAPER!"
One possible explanation for the  Coronavirus insanity.  (There are only three possibilities that fit all the facts)
"When Coronavirus  Is found to have little impact On World health -  They will tell us, With all seriousness, That we were SAVED By the Draconian measures That they implemented.  The virus Within two months Will be a non-issue.  Just watch!)"
"We are destroying our economies, And giving up our freedoms to assemble And move freely ...  For fear of a virus That has killed 100 times fewer people than the flu ...  In the same period of time.  We are watching a society In the throes of insanity."
"In the almost six months of its existence, The Coronavirus has killed 4,000 people worldwide.  In that same period of time (flu season), The flu has killed over half a million.  Yet the media focuses on Coronavirus.  Smell the coffee people."

The heart of my Presidential platform:  Observational osmosis.
Excellent article on the Coronavirus  Written by my Campaign Manager @Loggiaonfire
To my Campaign team:  Let's thank our North Carolina team for mobilizing votes in the Libertarian Primarries.  Our primaries have just begun And the North Carolina results show that I am in a statistical dead heat with the front runner for nomination.  Let's continue this roll.
Hapoy birrhday again my friend.
Not a single Libertarian Presidential candidate Would accept me as their VP running mate.  So now I'm running for both POTUS and VP positions.  Libertarian Party Heads require separate elections for each position (idiots).  So I'm running for both.  I'm having fun. Are you:))?
"They say I would do anything to get elected.  Yes!  I've already eaten my mother; Abandoned my dog; Sold my children into slavery; Slaughtered infants, And tortured my Grandmother.  All for 2 percentage points.  Here's the sordid truth of me:"
"I regret that I must, Once again, Reverse my prior self.  No one in the Libertarian Party Would consider me For Vice President.  I must return to my run For President.  BTW...  Accoring to Reason Mag: I came in second In the North Carolina Libertarian Super Tuesday elections:)"
"People trash me because my ""Doctorate"" degree is ""Honorary"".  Ok.  I skipped four years of hard work ...  But have the same rights, honors and privileges of those Who did not skip it.  Yes.  What an idiot am I?  *** YES ***  Still on the Opium."
"Our situation Today -- This madness --  Is incomprehensible.  And if something cannot be comprehended, It cannot be explained ...  So stop asking for explanations!!  Just do something!  (Sorry ... still on the opium)"
"Love  Is nothing more than Lust, Lust, And more lust,  With a lot of cheating Lies And subtle deception Thrown in.  Sorry folks ... But this is the opium talking.  This trip should be over in a few hours.  Bear with me."
"Why are people so unsettled, Disturbed, Anxious.  Because they are constantly in dull company.  The company of themselves."
When women give birth To Calfs heads;  When actors Forget they are acting;  When pigs fly;  It's time to put down the opium pipe.
"Most people Lead lives Of quiet desperation.  Meaningless to Heaven,  And of no interest to Hell."
"I am 74 years old.  I am standing on the far edge Of life - Looking into the darkness.  The light behind me - The light Of my experience,  Is of no further value To me ...  Perhaps it is of no value To anyone.  If so ... What is life for?"
I believe Justin Sun forgot one thing about Steem:  It is a community.  And ...  Communities Cannot be purchased.  It's like trying to collect water With a sieve.  @justinsuntron  @steemit
Why does power alway corrupt  Those whom we put in positions of  power?
"Damn!!!  Had I seen this earlier, I might not have terminated my Campaign.  But ....  We can replace ""President"" With ""Vice President"" -  The REAL most powerful man in the world,  Because few know the name, Let alone give a f*ck about what he/she does.  Imagine the possibilities!"
And if any of you Are unfamiliar with @VerminSupreme   Here is a photo of the two of us during the Libertarian 2016 Presidential Campaign.  A man of stature  Virtue  Intelligence And wisdom.  Loved and respected by all.
What I though about that Family Guy episode.  I generally love Family Guy.
I regret That I am ending my campaign for President.  I am instead Attempting to run For the Vice Presidential slot.  I have asked my Campaign Manager @Loggiaonfire  To contact the Campaign of Libertarian  @VerminSupreme  And offer to be his VP pick.  Full explanation in video.

And a personal offer Directly from me.
April 23rd to 27th.  Turkey  Last chance for me To meet you in person. The Government of Turkey Has guaranteed me safe passage. Not likely to get an offer like that again.  Anyway ...  I will be there the full four days.  Attendance is limited. Signup now:
"I am at war With my government.  It was intended to represent This great nation of profound beauty, Bordered by two vast and different oceans.  A nation which nourished and nurtured me.  Instead, it is a parasite On that very precious thing That it was intended To watch over."
This was an awesome interview.  I thoroughly enjoyed doing it.
You guys are about as useful As a fish With a bicycle!!!  Anyway ...  Here's my bacon and Whipped cream creation.  I added guacamole for color.

"Who are we To other people?  We are, Either, Entertainment, Or of some use to them,  Or we are nameless ghosts, Whose comings and goings Are of no interest,  And mean nothing."
"I get the point that posession of a penis, for some people,   Indicates ""Man"".  However ...  My FIRST IMPRESSION of These four ""men"" was ... ""Woman"".  Maybe I got bad eyesight."
"A question popped up in my anal fisting thread about Thai Ladyboys.  Men or Women?  My experience is limited to taking them home by mistake.  But ...  In spite of their male genitals, I have always considered them women.  You decide.  Image verification:"
"People ask: ""Why am I fascinated by anal fisting?""  I'm not.  Some women, though, Demand it! And few men can carry it off.  So -- I'm just advertising:)  @theemrsmcafee understands. Don't you babe?  And for the women fllooding my DMs With inquiries:  My wife must give permision."
"In my last tweet A commentor said:  ""Your stuff speaks to me.""  Let's avoid that nightmare, People.  Letting it be known That I speak to you,  Is the most dangerous Of all revelations:)"
My Sonata:  Composed for ... - The Coronavirus - The 2020 Elections  And --  Anal fisting.
It's not what you say That matters.  It's ....  Who   Is listening?
"Now that the insidious leap day is behind us, Here's a little known fact:  Once each Century we Skip a leap day.  Necessary, Since the Earth's revolution Around the Sun,  Takes slightly more than 365.25 days."
"This is how power creeps:  Homeland Security was established after 9/11,  To help insure violent terrorist attacks Could be countered.  Today ... Their shield Proudly protects Hollywood,  From wrongful Copyright Infringement.  No .... Seriously ....."
"Surely our average I.Q. As a society, Has not suddenly Shifted Into negative numbers?!  Sone said ""Refusal to pay taxes"" is ""Tax evasion"".  No ... seriously!  Educate yourselves.m!  Tax evasion is misrepresentation of income.  I have never done that.  I merely refuse to pay."
"The U.S. wants me For tax evasion.  Nonsense!!  I simply refused to pay.  I have been open, honest and vocal about it,  For the past ten years.  Wake up!"
Don't know how  To describe  This:
"People caution:  ""I don't know what I'm up against"".  But I have been up against this corrupted government for most of my life.  I know it better than it knows itself."
"Of all the freedoms We have renounced,  The one that is harming us most -  Is our freedom to absolute privacy regarding our finances --  Where our money comes from,  And where it goes to."
"Went to a fancy restaurant tonight.  As a joke, I asked if they could make squid with strawberries and cream for desert.  Waiter did not bat an eye.  I got battered squid rings with strawberries and cream for desert.  It was awesome! Go figure!"

"We can only move forward, If we abandon parties entirely, And understand that we all ...  Every one of us ....  Are unique ...  And can't be molded  Into any group -  And that we  Can only form a Government  Of individuals,  If we expect our Government To function  At all"
"How do we end the two party system?  It ends when we, The People, Abandon it.  As long as anyone persists  In clinging  To their party's beliefs,  Then ...  This nightmare will continue.  Wake up people!  Join the revolution Of the mind."
"Our two party system is destroying America.  Corrupt Party leaders use party loyalty To pass laws and regulations That are destructive To our freedoms.  Wake up people!!  We are all being used,  Irrespective of our political beliefs and positions."
"If you say: ""It's white"", Then I agree: ""It's white"".  If you Say: ""It's black"" Then I, as well, Must insist: ""It's black"".  Any other perspective Frightens and unsettles The sheep  And the shepherds,  Then ....  Have way more than wolves To worry about."
"If you greet everything With a broad smile of acceptance,  As if you had never before seen it, and ... It was something new, And unique,  Then the world would instantly tansform From the nightmare You now see,  Into the heaven It has always been."
"My Campaign advisors Are concerned About my profanity:  Words like - F*ck, Sh*t, P*ss And others That are irresistible to me.  So I agreed to hire A public speaking coach.  Anyone with Tourette's Syndrome That might be interested in the job, Please DM me."
"My fifth Presidential Campaign video:  The solution to all of our political, financial, social and personal problems  Through neat, manicured hands.  And a tiny bit of charisma."
"If ...  In order to help authorities Catch criminals ...  We must give up  Our fundamental right  To privacy In all of our affairs,  Including financial -  Then we Have given up More than Criminals Could ever take from us."
People ask:  What must we do To shrug off This corrupt Government?  Simple:  Just walk away.
"It's nice To be with companions Who can validate your own views,  But ...  Far nicer To be with those Who can invalidate them."
My two pronged approach to ending the divisive politics of our two party system.  Please watch with an open mind.

I have chosen James Corwell as my 2020 Presidential Campaign's running mate.  James is one of my body doubles and he survived an assassination attempt in Saigon 2 months ago.  He is my longest running body double and he is by far the smartest.  And the greatest surviror.
I am considering one of my body doubles as my running mate for the 2020 Presidential campaign.  Any thoughts?
Those of you saying you would love to be one of my body doubles.  Get real.  Three have been poisoned.  One shot and killed.  2 have been in prison for nore than ten years.  Takes more than balls to be ine of my body doubles.
"This argument came up because  Yesterday,  I tweeted I had been arrested 23 times.  One of my doubles brought up the fact that 7 of those arrests were my body doubles  Pretending to be me.  If I don't count those arrests, my arrests are a trivial 16.  Unacceptable."

Coronavirus facts:  Less than 2% of all cases result in death.  Approximately equivalent to seasonal flu.  Relax people.  Don't buy into this charade.  Something far more important is happening in the background.

Our travelling companion:  A long eared rabbit we call Junior.
"Shirley Scott - Associate Warden in charge of things;  Like choosing cellmates;  Chose multiple murder suspect Tartaglione,  To be a cellmate for a suspected pedophile.   Anyone else been to jail other than me?  You know how ridiculous that was.  Next:  Who told her to do so?"
"Taking a circuitous rout through France.  Picked up a tail.  Deciding what to do next.  Have a safe house in England,  If we can reach it.  Will publish name of high level official  Who chose Tartaglione as Epstein's cell mate.  When we stop.  Things will get hot  From here on."
My security team has arrived.  To escort us to England.

"Freedom comes,  When you are no longer Moved  By propaganda."

I finally get a job stripping.  Made a shit-load if cash
Having a bit of fun
"At a strip club.  None of my compatriots (except @theemrsmcafee, myself, and our bodyguard) had ever been to a strip club.  The night is just beginning.  The adventure begins:)  For real."
One if our party is a master pussy magnet.  He took his napkin and made a rose out of it.  The waitreses were swooning.  I've already signed up for lessons.
The Red-neck crowd is growing here.  Will wait a few more minutes.  The authorities usually take 24 to 48 hours to respond to a U.S. request to detain someone.  We can party all night!  Show up.
Those who live here and still need a f*cking hint on which beer place:
Ok. Ok.  Yes dozens of beer places.  But I thought everyone would think of HB.
"We need assistance.  Need to borrow 5 random telephones with established usage.  I will be at THE beer place three blocks from here at 5:00 local time.  If you are looking for an adventure,  Show up.   Wear something red around your neck."
"The photo below is making its rounds. It is not me.  James, whose mutual devotion we have shared for half a lifetime,  Has paid his last full measure of devotion.  At no point did I ever see him take drugs,  Even when they were offered.  We are in the run again. More soon."

"A 26 second public message from the McAfee2020hq,com Presidential Campaign."
No one rightly guessed who assisted Tartaglione;  To enter/leave Epstein's cell;  So he could whack him.  It's a low level conspirator.  Any hacker could find out!   And...  We need the name so we can follow the chain.  I'm waiting til tomorrow.  If no-one gets it.  I'm telling:)
".@theemrsmcafee and I escaped the D.R. After only 4 days in jail ...  Because ..  I had $150,000 in cash on my person, And, I got it to a lawyer before the authorities could take it from me.  And ...  Lawyers can turn water into wine in the D.R. :)"
"I never had a career. Never even thought about one.  I just worked for whoever paid me the most. And moved wherever, Whenever I pleased.  And one day,  ""I"" was able to pay me the most.  I've worked Only with that boss Ever since."
It costs tens of thousands $ per month for @theemrsmcafee and myself to stay hidden.  Ridiculous you say.  Then consider:  My enemy will spare no expense.  And they are the richest country in the world.
How have @theemrsmcafee and myself avoided being found for the past 8 months?
"There are three kinds of power:  The Power to create, The power to acquire, And the power to destroy.  The power to create Is ever with the people.  The other two must be removed from Government.  We need a Government with zero power, Controlled by  An all powerful people."
Catalonia.  Now THAT's what I'm talking about people!!!  When will this happen again in America?  Ever??  My heart breaks at the apathy of the Youth in America.
"The heart of the Freedom Movement in the world today,   As it was in the early 20th Century,  Is Catalonia.  I do not know why.  I only know that it is absolute truth."
"First look:  My friends in Tarragona, Spain, sent me this personally made video of the massive explosion (not exactly accidental) at the Tarragona refinery last week.  Notice:  Everyone is running TO the explosion.  Need I say more?"
"What is Freedom?  It is a condition,  In which you make all decisions about what you put into your body And your mind.  And ....  Within the bounds of reality's constraints,  You make the final decisions on your actions."
"You will never be free,  Unless you get a little crazy."
"Get rid of your vices, your sins, your defects?  You cannot.  They are a part of you.  We are all loving, kind and compassionate.  And, simultaneously,  We are jealous, angry and petty.  This is what we are people.  Embrace the truth of yourself.  Every part of you Has its place."
"We All have demons With which we struggle.  Mine is Vanity.  I confess it.  But I have lived with it for 74 years,  I know it well.  It is part of me.  I attempt only To keep it entertained with trivialities.  I oft do not succeed.  Those of you who are more perfect:  Troll away."
"If someone is brave enough to carry a sign that you cannot accept,   And you brave enough to carry yours,  Then you will at least have an opportunity  To have a discourse between two brave people,  Instead of between two sheep."
"People ask:  If we do carry a sign in the streets, What should it say?  Whatever you want.  But think --  Wouldn't a blank sign say the most?  It's the true voice we have in our Government."
"You won't carry a sign?  Because you might look foolish?  ""What can we do that diesn't carry that risk?"" You asked.  If you won't take the risk of looking foolish,  Then what risk ARE you willing to take?  All action carries risk.  But inaction Is the greatest risk of all."
"What can we do? I'm asked.  Are you ready to do?  If so, then write whatever is wrong As you see it, On a sign.  And carry it into the streets.  Looking foolish is the worst that can happen.  There is only action in life.  All else is hoping, wishing or complaining."
"These numbers might have been much smaller,   Had DNA testing been around while I was growing up.  No interest at this point.  To me,   Legacy has nothing to do with blood  And everything to do with the understanding -  That every child who crosses your path,  Is your child."
Since you asked:  I have 47 children.  61 grand children  19 great-grand children  I have met none of my great-grand children.
"I'm not here to give you solutions; For anything.  That's for you young folks of mine to do:  My lazy children, grand children and great-grand children.  Yes. I have great-grand children.  I'm here to point to the reality around you.  Which you children are so fond of ignoring."
"People ask why I don't offer solutions to the privacy problem.  It's because ...  There are none.  Not for the average person.  But isn't it better,  To know that you have no privacy,  Than to believe and act as if you do?"
"Encrypted email and messaging systems like Protonmail, Signal, etc provide privacy??  HahahahahahHa .....  Wake the fuck up people!"
"Encryption's purpose is to blind the ""Man In The Middle"".  But there is no man in the middle any more people!!  Your data is watched as you input it, prior to decryption  And read, after decryption, on the sane screen you are watching.  Wake up!!"
"Getting flak over Gmail.  You naive children.  I am only alive because I make security my highest priority.  I use Gmail because, as poor as it is, compared to CIA controlled, encrypted systems like Protonmail, Signal, etc.,  It's like an ironclad safe."
I had known that the Tennessee Bureau of Investigations had obtained a court order to force Google   To give them full access  To my Gmail account.  But I like confirmation before I respond.  Got confirmation today.  Sent myself this email:
"You say: ""A Corporation"", etc.  Giving something a word does not give you understanding.  It merely gives you an excuse   To not have to think."
"What do you want To fix In our Government?  Do you know what our Government is?  If not, How can you possibly fix it?  You cannot fix what you do not know.  And children ...  I promise you ...  You do not know."
"America is seen by other Nations as the ""Unruly Child"" of the World.  Willful. Hateful.  Able to push buttons and powerful people in distant lands disappear.  Swaggering the planet swinging a dick swollen with nuclear potential and violence.  The first World Dictator."
"I joined the Polar Bear Club and went swimming in the Baltic Sea this morning.  34 degrees F.  ""Invigorating"" barely touches the surface of the experience:)"
"I have nothing whatsoever to do with the Movie.  The only influence I have had was threatening lawsuits after Johnny Depp originally signed to to play me.  I like Johnny but he has nowhere near the depth of Keaton, whom I wanted.  I won that tug of war.  Keaton's replacing him."
Several times a day people suggest that a movie should be made about the madness of my life.  One came out three years ago.  The second is coming out this Summer. This one:  Keep up or get left behind:)
"Moving on.....  And back to the prison.  Left is Nicholas Tartaglione.  Epstein's cell mate/murderer.  If you were in charge, would you pair this man with a possibly pedophilic financier?  Someone did.  Right: Shirley Skipper Scott.  Associate Warden of the prison.  Nice folks."
"A reminder to those after me:  This was your third attempt, by poisoning FFS, in 8 years.  Get a clue.  My body is already pickled and preserved by alcohol and by more drugs than the Army's 5th Division could carry.  Wake up!!"
Our new comm room is up and running.  Just in time for the upcoming fireworks:)
"For you panicked people involved, even peripherally in Epstein's murder:  I do, absolutely, 1,000% have, not just a dead man switch, but a twice daily check in switch.  If you think you are fast enough to grab me, torture me and get what you need before it activates,  Think again"
I'm giving contestants until the 23rd to submit your guesses.  If no-one guesses I will reveal and then we will move on up the ladder.  Fair?
"I will slowly reveal the Epstein Murder plot.  We already found that Nicholas Tartaglioni killed Epstein, and Barbara Sampson was complicit.  Next:  I'm offering a free dinner to the first person to correctly name the person who removed Tartaglioni from Epstein's cell. :)"
.@NWordPassInt  .@china_zombie
"But even without those data files  Which are, as a sick joke, imbedded, open,  unencrypted and visible to anyone who passes by on multiple, rarely visited web sites,  Even without,  You can easily discover who moved Nicholas from Epsteins cell,  And how Nicholas got back in."
"Who moved Nicholas from Epstein's cell prior to the murder?  Critical!!  Hacker Hint:   From ths point on, every player, with exceptions of two players, was carrying an active cell phone during the action.  Dead meat for a good hacker.  Right answer gets a free dinner with me."
But let's drop these stooges.  Let's consider how Nicholas got back into Jeffrey's cell.  And who organized the apparent clusterfuck at the jail  which destroyed all evidence?  Cogitate this for a while.  You are lazy my children!!  Any decent hacker in the World Can answer that!
"Barbara Sampson performed her job so well that not only was no DNA testing done in the cell,  No testing whatsoever was done on anything whatsoever.  Point set to bitch Barbara.  Bitch? Oh yes.  As you will soon see."
My deal just came through.  May look insignificant to you but we're near the f*cking Arctic Circle and this shit is worth more than f*cking sled dogs.
"A public message from the McAfee 2020 Campaign:  How do we stop our children from pursuing this new, insane craze for getting high on this ""Stuffmonger Blow""?"
"I'm asked:  ""Is my phone not traceable?""  Only idiots carry phones.  Do @theemrsmcafee and myself look like idiots??"
"I'm biding time until Nicholas, Barbara, Weingarten (Yes - even defense attorneys are involved);  or some other;   Says something stupid that I can contradict with their own voice.  My game people.  My rules.  I'm only playing this for entertainment.  And no-one knows where I am."
Why did I abandon the field of Information Security four years ago?  Because it no longer exists in any form whatsoever.  At least no form that can protect us.
"How do I find shit out?  I founded the Word's first information security company.  If I am unable to break someone's security and  get any information I want - anywhere, anytime,  Then how could I know how to stop others from doing it???  Use your heads.  Jeesus Children!!!"
But Barbara .....  Now that bitch is something else.  There's a tiny tidbit for you lazy good for nothing children of mine.  Get off your butts and start digging.  I'm not doing this whole f*cking thing for you. :)
"These two acts were to shut down any investigation.  Nicholas was moved from Jeffrey's cell hours before the murder.  ""X"" gave him the key.  He entered, killed and left, after arreanging the scene.  If DNA is taken, it's his.  But he had lived in the cell for months."
"Release the truth about Government corruption?  OK. You asked for it.  Let's start with Epstein's murder.  The man who strangled him was Nicholas Tartaglione. Charged with mutliple murders.  Had nothing to lose.  Bargara Sampson provided legal closure.  ""Suicide it is"" she said."
"The broken neck bones alone - suggestive of possible forced strangulation,  Would cause any impartial Medical Examiner to withold determination until more facts were in.  Barbara Sampson acted as Prosecuter, Judge and Jury in this case without a shred of evidence  Or remorse."
"How could Barbara Sampson, the Medical Examiner, determine ""Suicide"" as the cause of death,  for the most important inmate in America,  Without at least estimating the time of death, or asking for a photo of the position of the found body?  Neither were done.  Wake up America."
"We have a system, called ""Mathematics"", which explains, in conjuction with science, the existence of the largest and tiniest details of everything, including life.  It is perfect, except for one thing:  It cannot explain it's own existence."
"I have two new advisors:  O.J. Simpson and the ghost of Michael Jackson, who, we know, REALLY killed O.J.'s wife.  To force O.J. to take his place as ""Top of the News""  For molesting one too many children.  It worked.  They will now help me unravel this twisted Epstein Conspiricy"
"Didn't occur to me....  You though the ""C"" meant Clinton.  Sorry to disappoint.  Neither of the Clintons played a part in the blossoming of the plot to suicide Epstein.  And listen children:  I'm an old man and have given you enough.  Find the rest in your own.  It will be fun."
"To me, the plot -- from missing tapes, guards who didn't show up on the cellblock, misalligned cameras, leaping over DNA obstacles, brushing it swiftly under the carpet by arranging Barbara Sampson for the autopsy .... all of it,  In my experience:  MASTERFUL!!!!!  Good Job C."
"And Second:  Arranging for Barbara Sampson to perform the autopsy.  Who ""conveniently"" forgot to put down the estimated time of death for the autopsy,  Thereby making everyone's alibi impossible to contradict.  Admirably clever."
"The 2 most clever parts of the Epstein Murder Plot:  1. Choosing Nicholas Tartaglione as Epsteins cell mate.  - Then moving him hours before the ""event""  - Then giving him the key to Epstein's cell.  Any DNA evidence would be from a recent cell mate and therefore inapplicable."
"Well boys and Girls ...  There goes Malta as a tax haven and supporter of Crypto ....  New Prime Minister going to shut us down.  I warned everyone:  Basing the future of Blockchain technology on the whims of politics,  Is a sure fail."
"The only Eskimo dance school, anywhere, to my knowledge, is in Tallinn.  That's why we're here.  Not for the dance.  But to sectetly record their music.  I have a contract with the Hopi Tribal Council at First Mesa to obtain recordings of Eskimo Dance music.  Didn't ask why."

"Next.  Was my wife, @theemrsmcafee, a prostitute for many years?  Well, my sex life and history are none of anyone's business, and Janice's is none of mine.  I have truly never once asked her what her occupation was.  But she feels differently and she will tell you all if asked."

Oops.  Made a mistake.  It's not epstein who's dead.  It's some Iranian General
"In Mexico, he hung around that day, with a man by his side (paid) until he saw a police truck coming. As they caught his eye, he bolted off, knocking down the man.  He was obviously chased and caught.  When caught, he said: ""I'm John McAfee. Please don't torture me.""  Simple."
Can no-one Google anymore?? :)  Ok ....  For those dozens who could find nothing:
"Google the arrest of ""John McAfee"", aka James Corwell, the night of my escape from Belize in November of 2012, you will understand the debt that I will always owe to this man.  Balls of titanium. The heart of a lion.  And friendship worthy of a wolf."
"People ask, from time to time, about my doubles.  Meet James Corwell, retiring today.  We have been virtually interchangeable for going on 31 years.  Be well my good friend. And I will never forget your night in a Mexican jail as me. It saved my life."

The truth of our evening.  Few will believe it.  It matters not to us.  It fucking happened.
The magic of @challengehaus:  They combined my anal fisting video with a sweet piano concerto for my lovely wife: @theemrsmcafee   Would have normally simply put a hit out on the Mofo's  But it actually sounded good.  Settled for busting their kneecaps.
"I contracted my first 2020 Campaign video the scoundrels at @challengehaus   Due to be completed today.  Paid them up front. Too much. But one was cute.  They're partying with my money, not simple things that I would do - drugs, hoe's, a little fun.  No.  Scary shit.  Help!!!!!"

Just broke my New Years resolution:  Stop smoking.
"A CHALLENGE TO MEMBERS OF GONGRESS  Are you willing to be tokenized on the Blockchain - meaning every penny that comes into or leaves any of your accounts must be digital, and every penny placed on the blockchain so the American people can forever see its movement?  If not, why?"
"Why is it crucial to tokenize every member of our Government on the Blockchain?  It comes down to money -- who holds it, who controls it, who spends it.  When all three of these are in the hands of the people, we will have a new world.  The Blockchain is our answer."
Why no president has had an ounce of power since 1960.  And why is anyone still watching this charade of political intrigue called the U.S. Government?

An important announcement regarding my 2020 Presidential campaign.
"How do we see Truth?  We have to question every one of our beliefs, even drop them completely.  If they were true, you will see that truth instantly re-appear around you.  If they were not, then they were your blindfolds and good riddance."
Morning madness
"Last year was fun. I stretched things, yes. I finally based my platform on anal fisting, as many of you saw. For  Those who saw the humor: you're welcome:)  But it's 2020 and time to get serious.   Our country is in a world of hurt.  My TRUE platform:"
"Eat my dick in 12 months?  A ruse to onboard new users. It worked.  Bitcoin was first. It's an ancient technology.  All know it.  Newer blockchains have privacy, smart contracts, distributed apps and more.  Bitcoin is our future?   Was the Model T the future of the automobile?"
My piano concerto for 2020.  My True Presidential Campaign Platform will be revealed later today.  I composed this specifically for that announcement.
"I berate my second in command, Nikita Karminsky, in three languages, over a drug deal gone bad:"
"For those new to the Blockchain and CryptoCurrency:  In the context of creating tokens for each Member of Congress, the words: ""Tokens"" and ""Coins"" (Money) are interchangeable.  ""Tokens"" are saleable. The vote associated with each token is not."
"This gives ultimate power to the people.   As we see the powerful accumulate coins, we may quickly remove them.  From their positions of power."
Every token comes with one vote.  Tokens may be purchased and sold.  The vote remains with the original owner of the token.  Forever.
"The tokens are trackable, beginning with one per registered voter per politician.  Politician supporters are motivated to keep the value if their ""Man"" high.  Watch as tokens are purchased - beginning with small batches then ...  Power accumulates through money.  Now with names."
"We're applying Blockchain to the Political Process by tokenizing Political leaders.  We'll show, scientifically, how power grows, accumulates and flows throughout politics.  We'll link news, decisions and actions to perceptions in the minds of American voters.  @BuyCongressman"
"We are emailing every registered U.S. voter one token per politician at no cost.   We will set the exchange price at one penny per token initially and then the Market will take over.  You may keep the token, sell all or part (up to a millionth of a token), burn it, or buy more."
".@BuyCongressman  We're using security tools to assure an initial seeding of one token, per politician, for every U.S. Voter. There is no initial cost for the token.  We'll then track each token's movement through our exchange. It will show how pyramid power structures evolve."
"No-one in Congress would co-operate with us.  Lawsuits were threatened if we proceeded.  The OLC Counsel threatened criminal charges if we also included POTUS candidates - ""Manipulating elections"".  Hadn't considered it til then.  But in May we will add them:)  Get used to it!"
"My team is tokenizing all 535 members of Congress.  The tokens will be listed on on March 1st, with every token set initially at one penny. Then let the trading begin.  Find out what your Representative is REALLY worth on the open market!  @BuyCongressman"

"I bought Purgatory wine at the monastary. Made by the same monks who grant devilish wishes.  The bald man kneeling next to me asked for hair. Four feet of dreadlocks instantly appeared.  Looked ridiculous on a pale, elderly man in a buttoned up shirt with a pocket protector."
"Those who say .. ""but .. but .. but"":  You merely WANT the President to be the decision maker.  To believe otherwise would destroy your entire construct of what you currently believe America is.  But denying the truth will not make the truth any less real."
You can only make decisions based on information.   Presidents are a blank slate in terms of understanding the real machinations of International intrigue.  That's for professionals.  The one who controls the flow of information to the President is the true decision maker.
"No PresIdent has had any power, including Trump, since 1960.  You think Trump was the one who decided to kill the Iranian General?  Wake up!  He acted on covert information.  Who gave him the information? And why? Was it true? We'll never know.  It's in front of your eyes folks!"
"We're blinded by government lies.  We see insanity in our government depending on our focus, like blind people meeting an elephant. If you encounter the leg, you may think: tree; the trunk - a snake; the side - a wall.  Wake up to the truth: See the full horrific picture!"
"Why do I work with the N Word project? @NWordPassInt  Yes. It's a trivial application of a new Blockchain technology, but this is just a test case.  They are working now on a breakthrough that will allow you get passes for non-violent socially unacceptable behaviours.  Imagine."
"I'd like to thank @money_alotta for helping my comrades at @NWordPassInt by doing a spectacular job on their Twitter header for 1/10th his normal (astronomical, but worth every penny, if I may say so) fee.  May the sun always smile on your face (unless it's a hot day), my friend."
"Re: Word Entitlement Project: @NWordPassInt  I can get a pass to say the Z Word, but they can't give me a pass to hear it!! WTF!!!  It's dual pass words like the Z and the BZ words that you would expect them to fix first.   And what's this obsession with the N Word pass?"
"But for real folks:  The true value of a tokenized Congress, given a Distributed ""Congressional Exchange"" - in which you can trade, say, your Pelosi tokens for a more effective Congress member - is knowing, every second of every day, the true value of a Congress person."
"As most know, my clients are an eclectic group.  I work with a company that will tokenize members of Congress, and auction the tokens. Token holders are owed favors. You can buy, sell, accumulate or even burn your tokens.  It will revolutionize the time honored system of bribery."
For those who want to apply: I would recommend applying early. I can see a huge wave of interest coming due to FOMO alone.
FINALLY!!!!!! Praise God Almighty!  I've already pre-applied for my Z word pass.

Most fun in 2019:  Accepting an offer by the CIA to find myself.   Offer was made through @china_zombie who stated they were suing me.  Problem is: @china_zombie is one of my companies (I have more than I can count).  They paid me a fortune to help them find me.  They didn't.

A New Year's composition for you folks:
"They first wanted to put Church members on the Blockchain and then extrapolate backwards to discover sins from their distant past.  Smelling money, and eager to please, I proposed a reverse-fork simulation using 3rd order partial differential equations.  Too costly. Said no."
Been consulting with a fundamentalist religious group that wants to use the Blockchain to ensure that church members are abiding by the faith (for real).  My concern:  Those who have not embraced the Blockchain might be denied everlasting salvation.  Am I doing the right thing?
"For those who asked ""What's the point?"":  Imagine a government that could control a population using drugs (been done before) without having to deal with the side effects or changes in society brought on by the drugs.   That drug would be the most valuable substance on earth."
"The Chinese Government has created a revolutionary drug called DY-XJ U. It has absolutely zero effects on physiology or consciousness. People behave normally.  It has zero side effects, except one:  Once ingested, the urge to re-ingest, approximately 24 hrs later, becomes extreme"
"I'll add to Janice's warnings about tonight:  - If you drug and drive use only those drugs that cannot be detected.  - If you're an Uber driver, good hunting.  For those that survive the night:   May you have a wonderful New Year."
"I'm going for a record of the most ""Ok Boomer"" comments in a single post. Please help!"
"It's the Boomers' fault!  I'm a Boomer. Born in the last days of the most devastating war in human history. Raised in a ravaged world.  Do you really believe life was handed to us on a silver fucking spoon?  Take responsibility! Did you ever speak out? Take action?  If not, STFU!"
"Ok, Ok ....  Here's why you can't watch this video unless you're 65 or older:  It's too dangerous. You couldn't handle it even with asbestos gloves.   Some things only Time can prepare you for. Let Time do it's thing."
"Our politicians act like denying something makes it unhappen.  They do it with such frequency, however, that I'm beginning to suspect they've discovered a way to ""unhappen"" things for real."

"** A PRIVATE VIDEO FOR THOSE 65 AND OLDER **  If you are younger than 65, you have absolutely no right to invade the privacy of us elderly folks.  Do NOT even THINK about watching this   video if you are 64 or less.  I F**king mean it!!"
"We know that the U.S. Government is fucked up. But it is illegal for me to say so in mainstream media.  The FCC has banned 68 words, and 1,000's of phrases.  But, ""Fucked Up"" is the best description for our government. I just can't say it.  Is America still the land of the free?"
"I have also allowed select women to fist me when they requested. No big deal.  It's not something I would put down as a ""required talent"" when looking for a date, but still - it had a certain intense quality to it which was not entirely unpleasant.  Relax people!"
How did we evaded the CIA for the past year?  We had better drugs.  And the God of Cybersecurity is on our side:)

Can't believe that someone as individualistic and steadfast as Trump could also be a puppet?  Think.  Wouldn't the greatest of all movies be the one in which the actors did not know they were acting?  How easy would that be in politics?

"On this Christmas Eve I am unfortunately, still at war.  Not with people, but with the things that people believe.  For the rest of this Season, however, I'm declaring a truce.  Merry Christmas all."
"A Christmas message from @theemrsmcafee and myself to everyone, everywhere:"
"Heading out of continent for the Holidays.  Merry Christmas to you and Yours!  May the ""Yours"" grow with each passing year."
"The ""N"" word is the most powerful word in the English language.  Feared by all, to the point it cannot be spoken aloud, whispered, even mouthed unless to the most trusted.   The world listens.  Those whom the word blesses, however, sing it.  Let us remember that this Christmas."
The Impeachment.  It's a numbers game people. We have a two party system with members of each party in absolute lock-step. We knew Trump would be impeached by the House. We know the Senate will not convict.  Two questions:  1. Why are we doing this? 2. Why is anyone watching?

Nations transition into Police States when Law Enforcement expands from solving reported crimes to seeking out crimes.  All citizens thus become suspects in all potential crimes.  You see it in the faces of officials as you enter and leave our country. Stone cold and suspicious.
What happened between Joe Rogan and myself:
In seriousness:  Tartaglione had been housed in MCC for many months. The prosecutors were asking for the death penalty. He had little to lose. Who better to recruit.  All you need to know now is who chose Tartaglione (below) as a cellmate for Epstein? There's your man.
"Why choose to have a cellmate whack Epstein, and why Tartaglione?  The architects anticipated a huge investgation, which they incorrectly assumed would include DNA testing. A cellmate would avoid suspicion.  Why Nicholas?   Ex police officer. Charged with murder. Get real people!"
Not knowing the time of death is convenient for everyone's alibi.
And try to find the Coroner's estimated time of death from Epstein's autopsy. It is also missing.

"Peaple urge me to go on @joerogan.  We don't speak.  We were once like brothers. We shared the same spiritual calling and were becoming ministers in our church. Had it not been for Rosita, we would, even today, be ministering together to those in need.  But that's another story."
"No one in their right mind would choose the life I have lived, if they knew how it would unfold.    Not even me.   But, having lived it, I would not change a single second for fear that the mystery and adventure of my current reality might be disturbed by that change."
"I said that shooting Smack, the first time, is like being kissed by God. Only the first time. Cries of ""Blasphemy"". Is it blasphemous to compare the Divine to a sense of bliss so overpowering that all eternity collapses into a single moment?  - Advertisement funded by Heroin Inc."
"I'm not backing off from Crypto. I'm backing off from promoting specific coins or projects. It's the Wild West here in Crypto. Even I cannot properly vet anything in this nuclear explosion of technology, promise and exploitation to the degree that I am comfortable promoting it."
"I'm no longer doing crypto promos. Not if God Her/Himself comes with a plan to use Blockchain for auto-erotic stimulation. Not even.  I'm moving to an all advertising plan for putting food in my mouth.  I will be accepting ads that make me laugh, etc. Nothing more. And only a few"
"Law now controls technology. Can't build crypto stuff without adding features for KYC and AML - which cripples the privacy feature of blockchains. It's insane. If the Feds want me to help them catch bad guys, then deputize me and pay me."

"I mentioned Vladamir Nabokov's groundbreaking book ""Lolita"" in a prior tweet. A commentor said ""Not a proper book to read"".    Even books about the subject, no matter how intense, profound or life changing, are now banned, not by burning but by shaming those who might read them."

"In all societies, those who wield ultimate power control society. Sorry.  Information is now the ultimate power.  Holders of information, like Google, are merely passive libraries, used by those with the power to turn information into the power to control the people.  Wake up!"
"Our law enforcement agencies have undue powers, as if catching criminals is more important than education, health, agriculture or any other branch of government. Law enforcement wields the power of surveillance and may therefore do what, in any other hands, is illegal - spy on us"
"1960. I was 14. America was still intact as Nation moving on the foundations of freedom. It was a thrilling time to be alive.  Today, 60 years later, America is growing into a totalitarian Police State, fueled by the power of information gleaned from electronic surveillance."

I just composed the background music to my fourth Presidential Campaign video. It will be about about the things I have seen that have been lost in America in my 74 years of being an American.
"To make it clear to those who might be following this thread but who are inference handicapped:   Saying ""Jews control Hollywood"" is now Hate Speech."
"Trump signed an executive order yesterday. Today, if I say, out loud, that Jews control Hollywood, in which 97% of all studio execs are Jewish, I have broken the law. For real.  I'm not antisemitic. Replace ""Jews"" with ""Navajos"" - it implies the same madness.  Wake up America!"
Fact or Fiction: Our right to privacy is still intact.  Public areas bristle with surveillance devices. Spy drones everywhere. Satellites see faces and license plates. Emails are monitored. Home devices listen to us. Our phones broadcast our location.  Fiction  Wake up America!
"Fact vs. fiction: The Constitution guarantees people will not be punished by any means prior to trial. Does our law match reality? Are people in the U.S. jailed prior to their trials? Yes.   ""Presumption of Innocence:?  Fiction  Wake up America!"
"We must be vigilant in our curbing of Government's powers. We have been lax for too long. While our attention was elsewhere, our Government ceased to be our servant; and became our master. It's time to take back the reins."

I think the movie I'm talking about is not this comedy here:)
"Stumbled across this old article from the time I was on the run in Central America: ""Drug fueled escapades with guns and prostitutes"". Brought an image to mind of a stoned and heavilly armed old man leading an army of prostitutes on a rampage of terror. Would make a good movie"
"I have private clubs in eleven countries; chosen for their laws that allow private clubs to actually be private. Short of eating children without their parents permission, anything goes.  Checked on this one. Had heard nothing for weeks. Turned out to just be good drugs."

"If you see something you hate in public media, does it change your opinion about that thing? Make you want to do it or embrace it? No. It harms nothing other than it creates hatred for the offender. Censorship wrongly punishes those we hate for the sole crime of being hated."

"World's first stop sign appeared in 1915, 20 years after the first car. Our rate of technology change is now exploding. Congress, in order to retain governmental control over us, is now attacking technology companies themselves in an effort to curb the rate of change. Wake up!"
"Laws must be flexible as society changes:  Automation cost millions of jobs but brought needed efficiences. Electrc cars will destroy our oil industry. New access to information will disrupt our system of education. Our laws governing work, industry and all else need to be fixed."

"If you don't see that our rights require permissions, try assembling in a city park without a permit; standing on a soap box on a street corner and speaking without a permit. Try starting your own religion without permits or buying a firearm without a permit. Rights are no more."
"Our rights now require permissions, so really, they are privileges. If we replace ""Rights"" with ""Privileges"" in our Constitution, we then have a nation with two classes: those with no rights, and those with the right to grant privileges; including to themselves."
"By deciding in advance whether a given public assembly will be ""peaceful"" and therefore lawful and permitted, cities are letting ""what might be"" influence ""what is"". This is the first indication of insanity. Next is refusal to let you speak because you may say something dangerous"
"There are no rights granted by the Constitution that still remain. Not even the right to publicly assemble. We must ask for permission, which can be denied based on any whim. A right that requires a permit to exercise is not a right; it has become a privilege. Wake up America!"

"My interview with the Jerry Brazie podcast. Talking sex, drugs, rock and roll, bestiality and prayer. It's about how prayer can improve our joy in the little, day to day perversions and debaucheries of our lives."

My AMA session at the Malta Blickchain Conference yesterday:
Happy thanksgiving everyone. Thank you for putting up with my drug trafficker ramblings on this joyous day. I thought this was a good day for it. I'm thankful I survived.
What to do if you are in some third world country (or in the U.S. if you encounter the right cops) and the police plant drugs on you. First and foremost: Don't panic.
"So you're caught with massive quantities of illegal drugs, nuclear weapons, human slaves (if the latter, I cannot possibly condone your chosen profession, but I do feel your pain of being caught) - so what do you do? Follow these easy, step by step guidelines:"
How to transport illegal drugs in Central America - knowing you will eventually be caught but could care less about it.
How Janice and I escaped being deported back to the U.S. after our release from a Dominican republic jail and being confined in Immigration awaiting deportation.
"Why did @theemrsmcafee and myself deviate from moving from place to place and country to country, a step ahead of our pursuers, to going into ironclad hiding? Here's the story:"
"My interview with the radical dudes at ""Exile Hour"":"
"My interview with @BenjaminPiruson the ""Crypto: Secrets of the Trade"" podcast. We spoke about #Bitcoin, taxes, and a few other topics.  YouTube Link:     Apple Podcast Link:"
I have been homeless - in my early wandering days. This is why I must say this:
"My statement in my prior tweet was not criticism of any stance on immigration. I was pointing to a problem, largely ignored, that converges with the immigration issue. In spite of what newspaper headlines say, the majority of the homeless I've encountered are white."
"People say that immigration is turning our country into a crap-hole. Look under our bridges; in cities like L.A. - teeming with the homeless, the desperate, the different. We are making our own crap-hole."
"I've been jailed, chased, hunted and attacked. I have lived in danger much of my life. Living in danger forces you to live outside yourself; to watch the world around you, studying and analysing people and situations, always looking for the enemy. It has taught me much."
My interview with cryptovania
My interview with Muddied Waters.
"I look for technology that can free people from surveillance. Optical data transfer has been one such technology but has been limited by weather. Now, a new optical technology has arived. Survellance must happen in the line of sight - currently impossible."
L.A.'s 405 Freeway pre-thanksgiving traffic. I'm told that people join this chaos of their own free will. For some reason I do not believe that free will enters into this insanity in any way.
My interview with (allegedly) Baptize Machine. They wore bank robber masks during the entire interview and claimed to have kidnapped my pet weasel in order to keep me on-line longer.
I had forgotten the insanity that went on last year. Thank God for the mild mannered and reserved @theemrsmcafee by my side to keep me calm:)
"Violence will not fix our broken system. Violence begets violence. Civil disobedience is the only way. Refuse to obey unjust, corrupt laws. Refuse to continue taking orders. Refuse to stand when told to. Refuse to move when ordered. Refuse to continue believing the lies."
"We must, for our following generations, fight for freedom, and pass that freedom on to them."
"Freedom is not being able to do as you please, nor is it freedom from something. It is the freedom to be yourself."
A free society is one in which those who are different or unpopular are as safe as those who are not.
".@CoinsBank collected us this morning at Lebedivka on the Black Sea. Brought us to Odesa to strategize the structure, facilities and content of future Blockchain conferences. The Blockchain is the future, and our conferences must reflect that. A new paradigm is coming."
Does it matter who the President is? Is your life actually impacted by a change of presidents? Why are we concerning ourselves with a puppet show when it is the puppet masters who write the script?
"Freedom in America is on it's knees. By electing those who seek power rather than service; by choosing those willing to pay the most for the office, we have become the author of our own destruction. Wake up America."
"There are still Neanderthals on SM who actually believe that people can get something for nothing. Let me disabuse you of this, at least in respect to myself. Ads like the following suggesting that I'm giving out money through helping the world or through gratitude are laughable."
The ballot impacts with more force than the bullet. Vote everyone out.

I don't remember being this honest with Markethive. Must have been seriously stoned. But I read it and it's true no matter how unbelievable it sounds. I sometimes feel that my life is an acid flashback - that it is too extreme to be real. Still not sure.

My interview with Callisto Community about the meaning of life.
My interview with Reuel Leach in South Africa:
The Epstein murder is unravelling. His guards have now been charged with falsifying records the night of his death. It will go all the way to the top. This would all have been swept under the rug if not for the attention of our memes. Memes have power.
"How to function sanely in a world where most people that you meet are interested only in themselves? It starts by seeing that we all carry, to some degree, that same trait."
"Even if we discount the source, we know that powerful, lifetime employees in the CIA want to whack Trump, and poison is the CIA's favorite whacking tool. CIA wouldn't do that? Please! Have we all forgotten JFK - the only President to challenge the CIA?"
"I'm filing a lawsuit against the D.R. Government for assets illegally seized. We weren't allowed to declare items with customs and were charged with ""failure to declare"" and jailed. This suit will lead to Paul Rolle - corrupt head of Bahamian Police, who set this up for the CIA."
"I've had more money than any one person should ever be allowed to have. One thing I know: riches bring stuff, but stuff is not life."
"One of my ventures is a cannabis operation. I am coming out with a new strain. I want to call it ""Dank Minge"". No-one else does. I'm putting it to a vote:"

Why don't people wake to the truth? It's because most people's lives are composed of approved and tightly controlled building blocks. Approved education. Approved attitudes toward drugs. Approved views on governance. Approved ingestible substances. To see this truth is painful.
"If stuffed animal abuse as a means of motivating children catches on, imagine what is in store for us adults:)"
"What do we do? I'm asked this constantly.   I don't know. It will be done, however, when our collective consciousness of  the Truth reaches critical mass. This is how the world changes, not by plans and tactics but by waking up to the truth and by waking as many others as you can"
"Watching for danger is a natural human trait. But our society has changed from a unified body that watches out for the enemy, to an organism looking for the enemy inside itself. It is a sign of insanity. We live in a surveillance state America! Wake up!"

"I'm sorry. It's clear from the comments that some did not grasp the depth of my prior tweet. A more precise wording would be: ""Is it wrong to refuse service to those that refuse to be served?"". I think that's as close as I can describe it."
"In our current ""correct"" social environment, is it OK to refuse service to those who don't ask for it? A friend needs to know."

Final proof!! Epstein didn't kill himself. #Epsteindidntkillhimself
"Jesus! It's the media feeding on itself. New York Post: ""John McAfee thinks Jeffrey Epstein was murdered"". The London Daily Mail: ""McAfee insists he wasn't murder"". Within hours of each other. Expect soon: ""John McAfee murdered Jeffrey Epstein and assumed his identity""."
How did this get started? It's popping up all over the place. I never said Jeffrey Epstein was murdered. I said he didn't commit suicide. Not the same. Could be alive. Could have never existed. Maybe murdered. I dunno. I only know he didn't commit suicide.
The SEC and IRS tell me I was wrong to create an anonymous and unrestricted DEX for use by law abiding citizens because criminals may also use the exchange. That's like saying automobiles can't be built because bank robbers will use them as getaway cars.
Do private individuals and organizations have an obligation to burden their products and creations with features that assist governments in preventing criminal activities?  Let's be real: the true criminals ARE the governments. My answer is - NO!

Yes. It's difficult to contact me. Should be difficult to contact anyone in this world of a thousand options. I only check Skype: mcafeenomad and Signal: 731 803 2457 (No .... calling that number will not work). I don't give out any other contact info but I check these once a day
"BAKKT goes live today. It is institutionalized and monitored. It will add new users to the crypto sphere -- that's good, but if you are ""initiated"" into crypto, then you certainly won't use it and will spend time luring the new users into the ""Unlimited Crypto World."""
"""Custody of Funds"" will be the fulcrum than defines ""good or bad"" in any future Crypto exchange, Futures Market or new coin offering. If you don't have custody, then any crypto offering is no different from a bank, that holds your money, reports on it, follows it and controls it."

Government 101. Today's topic: self preservation of the Government.
"First half of my interview with Crypto Grown Ups. Freedom, Cryptocurrency, government control:"
"Was supposed to keynote the planting of the Crypto Coin Tree at the GCC (Global Crypto Co-Op) headquarters, but they busted a pipe digging the hole. Waiting til Monday now. The tree, literally, has multiple disk shaped leaf arrangements. World's biggest bonzai.  Staying over ..."
"I'm getting Google flack:)  Yes, Bing and Duckduckgo are options. But DDgo uses Bing. Bing uses Google, so Google still controls the knowledge. Let's all get real here. Please."
"U.S. wants to break up Google. Tread carefully. No matter what evil Google may or may not have done, inagine your life without instant access to the World's store of knowledge. Life is not perfect. If you think you can take the good and not the bad, move out of your mom's house."
No contradiction to support BAKKT while refusing to have anything to do with it. We need the current system to build the tools with which we will dismantle it.
"BAKKT goes live tomorrow.  It is an institutionalized exchange so I won't be using it, but institutions will feel a level of trust that they had not had. It could jump-start Ctypto adoption. But remember - it is the opposite of freedom's movement."
Anarchadelphia posted my keynote.
"So it begins people. The Government side of the Government/Corporate alliance makes its move to curb the growing power of the corporations over the people. The Government wants all of that. Whatever happens, we, the people, will lose."
Jared Dillian joing the In Crowd. Finally!
I'm having a mix-off with @MrRussellDavis in Kathmandu. Coming soon.
My keynote to the anarchists at Anarchadelphia. How Crypto can free you.
"The GCC (Global Crypto Co-Op) invited me to break ground for the planting of ""The New Freedom Tree"" tomorrow at their headquarters.  It's a 200 yr old olive tree, carved and trained over time into coin shaped branches. Now weighs 2.1 tons. From Spain.  Check tomorrow for photos."
Appropriate use of Blockchain for secure communications in the Crypto Space. IMHO
My home for the next few days.
I have joined as an advisor to   's R&amp;D department. They are an awesome blockchain accelerator for business applications as well as having a wide variety of mining solutions and the only fully insured exchange.
"The centralized Crypto exchanges will eventually die off. Distributed, decentralized exchanges are here, now. Start migrating whatever you can."
My birthday was yesterday. The one day a year I do nothing. Can't remember what I did.
"People ask where to buy my books. They are all trash and your time would be better spent watching weeds grow. If you insist, however, the shortest (one half hour) is the following. $9.95 on Amazon."
"Do people truly feel ""assaulted"" by seeing genitalia, whether the image is wanted or unwanted? ""Shocked"" I might understand, but assaulted? If so, stay away from nude beaches, saunas, San Francisco and most warm weather tribal societies."
Power of the Media: The New York Times did a scathing article accusing Brett Kavenaugh of exposing himself to a woman while in college. They left out one fact: the alleged victim does not recall the event. Would seem memorable enough to me.
"Exchanges want all of your personal information, and eventually it will all be hacked or leaked. We have already seen multiple examples of this. It's time for something different. Decentralized exchanges like @switchdex that require no information whatsoever are a game changer"
Mixology 101. The single malt donut.
Ooops .....   Never post stoned.  I went to a f*cking bull fight. Get over it.
"My last word on the bullfight:  What's happening in the arena is nothing. A bull is tortured and killed. The true horror is the thousands of cheering, slathering, hungry people surrounding you. That, my friends, is true learning."
"""could nothing more educational could come out of watching a bullfight other than the adornments the horses wear?""  Yes. I got to feel, see and hear the real horror of the event. You cannot know what you have not met. I now know a bullfight."
"The Bullfight:  The refusal to look at the things we believe we hate, no matter how terrible as viewed by tiny clips on TV, is our fundamental problem. We now get our facts from media rather than venturing into the world to see for ourselves. The media is our new drug of choice."
Getting trashed for supporting bullfights by attending.   I want to know the world I am living in. In all its forms. Attendance does not imply approval. It is a barbaric custom. I was profoundly disturbed. But it exists. With or without my few dollars admission.
Stopped in Spain to see a bull fight. High drama and much brutality. But the armor on the Pecaderos' horses was fascinating. The horses' ears are closed and blindfolded so they cannot hear or see. Otherwise they would not go near the bulls. I saw one lifted in the air by a bull.
Time to talk Crypto.
"It's happening folks. Neural networks now able to imitate human brain functions. Why don't we just couple that with AI, throw a barrel full of million dollar bills at and sit back, relax and watch the end of our species in living color."
I believe my urgings to the Cuban people to use Crypto to avoid U.S. Sanctions took root.
Yes. I'm still running for President. Please! Be warned.
Our dog Marley died yesterday. I didn't have the heart to mention it when I posted this piece yesterday. This is for him.
We lost Marley. This was the real motivation for my last piano piece. He is sorely missed.
"Ok. Ok. .... this really IS my last, very last goodbye to the piano:) I promise!"
A last goodbye to the piano. For how long? I have no clue.
Set failure.
Mixology 101. Sorry for the delay.
"Googling myself, in an effort to discover what I've been up to lately, I found out that more people search for me on Google than for David Bradley. Who the f*ck is David Bradley?"
Who you gonna take orders from?
Look around you. Please.
I say goodbye to the piano for a while.
Back in the air. Headed for parts unknown.
"The government invades our privacy to ensure we are not the enemy. This act of aggression occurs because we, the people, are not trusted by the government we created."
Time is short. I'll just leave this right here.
Staying in a top notch hotel in Dubai. Their A.I. toilet malfunctioned and tried to attack me. I fought it off with my advanced Karate training.
"The odd thing to me was the confidence displayed by the waiter weilding what appeared to be a fish bone. As if to say: ""This happens twice a day -- little girls getting spiders caught between their teeth. Fish bones are the only solution""."
"Sometimes covert videos are worth posting: ""The little girl with the spider caught between her teeth""."
"What is Surrealism?  My compound in Rodeo, NM was cooled by industrial coolers. I could cool the entire house to below freezing. In Summer, when the temp was 110 degrees, I would cool it to 33 degrees and build a fire in the fireplace. Visitors experienced Surrealism firsthand."
"Laid down the law with Omar. Told him next time he annoyed me I would break him in half and feed his bottom half to his top half. Also fed him. Hadn't eaten in four days. Too many drugs. Decided to rename him ""Junior"". Seems to have worked."
I have a CBD producing client that needs a testing lab capable of guaranteeing that their products contain no contaminants or impurities. Testing must be done daily. If you are a testing lab capable of meeting these requirements contact: cbdassurance@gmail.com
Been re-captured. Never should have dallied in that Afghan brothel.
"Owner of Gregor's Restaurant in Iceland when the press asked about me: ""I don’t know when he arrived, if he arrived at all. If I talked to him, then I’ve forgotten about it.""   God bless you Gregorz. I will never forget you."
"Stopped by Wichita, Kansas, to visit @theemrsmcafee's friend, Dottie. Dottie, unfortunately, disappeared a few years back, along with her Airdale, Tonto. Not wanting to waste the trip, we tooled around Wichita lake. Beatiful Architecture.  As falls Wichita, so falls Wichita falls"
.@china_zombie says people are testing infection vectors for the release of a powerful Research Chemical that causes zombie-like symptoms. This Washington Post story about a purposeful contaminant in many CBD products should scare you. What better vector?
"Industry leaders Team McAfee and Apereum, Inc. launch Illumnine, a full-service business incubator supporting blockchain &amp; tech startups on a global level check us out   #teammcafee #apereum #blockchain #technews #global"
Omar. Still pissed that I scarfed more than my share of the drugs.  He should have Googled me.
"Left: me in captivity. Right: Ancient Navajo burial chamber - designed by Hopi builders and loosely patterned after Renaissance era Verona architecture. Proof, by the way, that Native Americans discovered Europe long before Europeans discovered America."
I accepted Janice's proposal.
".@theemrsmcafee proposing to me in the village of Pinon, Black Mesa - heart of the Navajo Res, Arizona.  She forgot we were already married."
I am refused admittance to the Navajo Tribal Council.
Janice and I escaped on our jet. My captors are following in a faster jet. Will keep you informed.
I escape my captors. But only mometarily.
.@china_zombie plans $100 million lawsuit against me. Well..... they will have to stand in a long line. I've been sued over 200 times and have over $3 billion in judgements against me. No-one has collected a single penny. Why didn't they Google me first??
Partied all night with my captors. MDPV all gone. Searched for the Desomorphine to bring us down. Discoved I had popped the last four pills. Thought it was Scopolamine. Offered to chuck it back up so we could pick through the effluent. Omar said no.
I've been kidnapped by men in an armored limo. They speak Serbian with heavy Australian accents and claim to be only partially circumcised (left half of foreskin). I saw little benefit and declined to follow suit. They got good drugs. Should I sound an alarm or invite my friends?
Sitting Bull and immigration. Or why names are important.
"From my good friend, @money_alotta. I want the food and drug printer."
Sneaking into Canada; a simple checkup; Sitting Bull and snow gently falling. An allegory for America.
"I am releasing a preliminary, incomplete version of the @china_zombie White Paper, mostly to shut up @AdamGuerbuez and a horde if other trolls who are trashing the WP without having seen it. Here it is:"
Our Government justifies it's insanities by making insane laws. Clultivating weed is gardening no matter which way you slice it. The insanity of the law against it is justified by the law itself.
The U.S. Government has become an asylum for the criminally insane.
"For those of you with Tor browsers: meet one of my underground teams. Got juicy info on the Government - any government - State, Federal, local, police, beaurocrats ... you name it? Let these soldiers know. Tor browsers only:"
"CT can't get enough of the Zombie Coin? No. It's too much.  People hate me for charging @china_zombie $4.5 mil; for deceiving folks about zombies; for the White Paper they haven't read yet. Wait til it's f*cking released. If you find it at fault, then OK."
"The FTC cracks down on Social Media over failures to stem ""Extremism"". But ..... If we ban extremism, we will be at the mercy of those who define and judge that term. What is extreme, today, becomes the norm of Tomorrow. Just how it works."
"From ZeroHedge: ""Sex Robots prone to violence and strangling humans""  Good news for those into erotic asphyxiation!"
We flew to a warmer climate to do some skeet shooting this weekend. @theemrsmcafee and myself had a blast. Quick trip over the Caspian Sea and back.
"His Assholiness has alleged I demanded 25 million coins from @china_zombie. F*uck no! I demanded 100 million and changed my mind and now asking for twice that. So what? His guess is so far off the mark that how can you trust anything he claims? You're serve, your Assholiness."
"His Assholiness has spoken. I await, with great expectations, his divine revelations"
Me: flying a helicopter over the Baltic Sea yesterday. Yes. I am a pilot.
"Good God!!!! These people at   actually appear to like me. Or at the very least, treat me with complete indifference."
"Asked how much I get:  For which project? The zombie one? A huge amount. So much that it would be embarrasing to divulge. No .... so much that the average person would sell their grandmother into slavery for. Enough to make most folks lie, deceive, cheat and steal. That project?"
I sometimes read the news about me just to take the world's temperature in relation to myself. Normally I learn a lot that I never knew about me - fascinating shit! Sometimes I learn nothing - meaning there are no lies there. No lies in this story:
Mixology 101. The art of drinking Scotch.
Russian Television (RT) reports on our forced move.
Weed smokers who are fussy over mouth germs when passing weed:
My new voice implant doesn't work.
"Bitcoin under $9,500. If you are panicking, you are a fool."
The CIA notified of my location:
"Best article yet on the issue: Do the zombie movies reflect an exaggerated existing reality, or is the existing research into zombies a misguided effort based on the fiction of movies?"
.@theemrsmcafee and I have moved. We moved because some a*hole publicly outed our location. Janice and I have settled in to a new safe house in a new country. Weather still sucks but at least our Comm room is fully mobile and will arrive soon. We will miss Gregor's.
My Bitcoin Radio interview - why I don't give a f*ck what people think or say about me:
"We have been outed. You cannot blame Adam. It would have happened eventually. The slip up was mine - mentioning Gregor's Eatery. I, in fact, commend Adam for his intelligence and insightful work. If I had money, I would hire you Adam. We are on the road again."
"Been reading and re-reading our Constitution, searching for the fine print saying: ""The People"" are defined as those in the Government who have reached a level of power where they are immune to this Constitution."
"I was raised in the U.S. I went to school, kissed my first girl, got my first job, raised a family, hoped for our future. I love America with all of my heart. But I am at war with the government of my country, which, I fear, bears little love for anything but itself."
Yahoo Finance now talking about zombies. What is the world coming to?
"Composing a song for the managers, security and staff of the safe house that's giving me and @theemrsmcafee sanctuary."
My interview with Bitcoin Radio. Raw.
Transparency or Privacy/Anonymity in Crypto? Which is it ? It's a simple answer that you need to understand and understand now.
My interview with Chance Lundesford.- peppered with profanity. If you want to see me completely uncensored you'd better look quick before YouTube takes this one down too.
"What I believe about @china_zombie doesn't matter. They are my client. I was hired to write a White Paper in a truthful fashion. That's what I intend to do - with the full capacity of my intellect, my talents and my time that I promised to dedicate to this delicate venture."
The anti-zombie medallion from @china_zombie. Keeps zombies from eating you. They also allege that holders of CZ Zombie coins will be able to negotiate with zombies -- making them to do zombie stuff on your behalf. I purchased their entire first run. Can't be too careful.
"Many of you attempt to belittle my presidential campaign by suggesting I am in the same category as Vermin Supreme. I am nowhere near as good a politician as Vermin and I wish my intelligence were even half of his brilliance. We are good friends, as you can see for yourself."
"To those hating me for my cooperation with @china_zombie:  They are my client. My job is to write a truthful white paper, which I will do. Until I have done so, you have no basis for judging the value to @china_zombie or to the world at large of my work in this matter. Relax."
The @china_zombie people have created their protective medallion which all purchasers of $50 or more worth of the CZ coin will receive. The company insists that their retrovirus that has spread to all zombies is generically keyed to these medallions. Possessors will not be eaten.
"Our government has not only lost its way with us - ""The People"" - the voters. It has lost its way in the world at large - challenged now on every front. Unless we demand sanity in this government, it cannot stand.   via @politico"
"The China U.S. trade war may be over. Stock market will jump. Large corporations will benefit. Impact on the American public: you will have to pay one dollar more, or less, for a Chinese toaster. All this effort while we have real problems. Wake up people."
"People asking: ""Why does the zombie company need their own crypto?""  Because --- the coin is to be used by both Zombies and people. If a zombie attacks you, you can negotiate a transaction whereby you give the zombie a bunch of coins and it eats your neighbor instead of you."
My good friend's (@money_alotta) latest masterpiece:
"People trashing me for taking an advisory role with @china_zombie -- they believe in zombies, for example. In this short video I explain, as best my simple mind can do, why I would not only do it, but why it would be impossible for me to turn them down."
"Re: YouTube banning my interviews because I used the ""f"" word in relation to our political system:  You can fornicate with the system. Even sodomize it. You could screw it, pork it, jam it ...... But you just can't fuck it, or fuck with it, else the system will get all fucked up."
"Rober King's - @Thefotoking - raw video of the five days we spent without sleep, dealing with various officials. More hard money displayed on the table than anything you've seen outside of movies, and more guns and tension than most of you could dream of."
YouTube banned my interview with MMCrypto because of language. This is the first time one of my interviews with an acceptable news outlet has been banned for any reason. Expect more for many different reasons. This videonis my response to YouTube. I'll now be permanently banned.
"Hackers acting on behalf of the U.S. Justice Department have attacked one of the outer servers of my cloaked network. Still years away from tracking my actual location, but the fools are trying. Good luck -- you are on my turf now, playing by my rules."
"It's up, running, and fully functional. Practice trading under real market conditions without risk, Shadow Trading, and more. Give it a try."
Thanks @money_alotta for the @China_zombie website header which my team is building. Thank you Phillippe for all of your help on this project. Few artists wanted to touch it due to the extreme bizarre claims of the Center. In all truth I've encountered stranger things.
"CoinRivet's take on my advisory role with @china_zombie.  Yes, the research center believes zombies exist and they're teaching them to use crypto currencies. Even with a one chance in a million of being true, I just couldn't pass it up. I smell adventure."
"My interview with Chris Jaszczynski and MMCrypto just came out. Short, but not so sweet. Bitcoin Maximalists will foam at the mouth I fear."
Our Shadow Trading feature now live on
"Many say: I'm shilling @China_Zombie 's CZ coin so why don't I shill any damn thing for money? No. I only take jobs that fascinate me. A company that, in all seriousness, insists that zombies exist and can be taught to use Crypto currency - well - I'm fascinated. Who wouldn't be?"
"To my critics: it isn't my job to determine the validity of @china_zombie 's claim that zombies exist. My job us to ensure that the white paper for the CZ coin is factual and informative regarding all aspects that affect the creation, distribution and use of the coin. That's all."
I have accepted an advisory position with @China_Zombie to help them with the CZCOIN ($CZ) creation and promotion. I will be shilling them heavilly. You have been warned. I want no flack. Thank you.
"People want to know: How can I access Twitter from a safe house, even with Faraday cages, signal jammers, etc. Answer:  Multiple private VPNs coupled with multiple public VPNs in the outer shell. Would take 10 years to unwind. We're in my bailiwick now mof-&lt;ckers!"
Shadow Trading is now fully functional. You've been asking for it. Here it is.
"Those who haven't figured it out: Faraday cage communication room, 8 channel signal jammer, no photos or videos outside, except of a piano with a blank background, for over a month. We are surely in a safe house somewhere in the extreme northern hemisphere. We are at war folks."
"We must stop Americans from emigrating to Mexico and to Canada, and stop them now!!"
For those few of you who can see my Tweets - I've been shadow banned big time. Not sure what precipitated it but I will find out and report.
Careful babe!! Joan Rivers was whacked right after publicly declaring that Michelle Obama was man. You don't want people to think you are implying the same. I think what you're seeing in that there dance video (and other videos) is simply spare change jangling around.
"Lincoln Chafee will run against me for the Libertarian Party nomination. I think he may benefit the party. If he runs I'll vote for him. As we all know, neither he, nor I, stand a rat's chance in Hell of ever being President. It's a 2 party system."
"Bitcoin jitters? Just stop it! Short term fluctuations are meaningless. Bitcoin is still up almost 300% from 6 month's ago. Everytime there's a dip I have to calm people in replies, DMs, etc. GET A GRIP! You know in your heart Bitcoin cannot lose.  Relax!"
"In February, here in Novaya Zemlya, there was a massive invasion of Polar bears. At least that's what the villagers claim. Not sure I believe it, but still axious to wrestle one to the ground and eat its heart. The villagers clain it gives immortality. Could use me some of that."
Thank God!! Finally got some flannel shirts. It's August but frequently below freezing here. Electric blankets and thermal underwear on the way. Yesterday heard of a Polar Bear sighting. Anxious to eat the heart of one of those. Raw is best I hear.
"People ask ""What can we do?""  You can speak out. With your voice, your words in social media, your images and GIFs ... your memes. With signs in the streets if necessary. With emails or letters to your politicians. In discussions with friends and family. Just do it!"
.@Thefotoking 's surreptitious video of my time while incarcerated in The Dominacan Republic. You haven't seen a jail till you've seen a D.R. jail:)
"Going out on the village tonight. Big time. Gregor's eatery doesn't close until the sun sets (never this time of year), and they serve hot wine (no idea how wonderful that is in this weather). Anyway ...it's a formal affair. Which face should I wear?"
"We created our Government to watch our borders - to watch out for for aggression from our neighbors, or enemies. For our military to stand watch. And to watch for opportunities for peace.  But now, our governmen is consumed with one thing ..... watching us."
"""WE'LL KNOW OUR DISINFORMATION IS COMPLETE WHEN EVERYTHING THE AMERICAN PUBLIC BELIEVES IS FALSE"" - CIA Director William Casey to President Reagan - February, 1981. - multiple sources.  (Verified by Barbara Honegger - in meeting ).   Well, fuck me ... that just about says it all."

"Questions about me calling myself an anarchist in my previous tweet. What is Anarchy you ask:  Anarchy is the total absence of external governance. It requires a people with enough insight and courage to govern themselves in order for it to work. We, as yet, have few such people."
"ANTIFA: I don't know if I'm with you or not. I hear that anarchists are among your group and there are none more anarchistic than myself. Yet you are mostly socialistic - which anarchists cannot be - we are ""No government. No help."" I'm confused. Someone enlighten me. Please."
"My promotional video for ""Purity Porn Products"". One of the best promo videos I have done, in my humble opinion. If you are considering using my services but are hesitant, please watch this to see the power of my promotional capabilities."
"I sometimes test commitment. My previous video titled - ""Nature vs Nurture?"". The video actually discussed the transition from Uteral bliss, to the sudden being thrust into the world. 80% of the comments addressed the headline. Never watched. Why comment on what you haven't seen?"
"Nature or nurture. Are we born with a sense of humor, or is it taught to us? Frankly, I don't give a flying f-&lt;k, but they forced me to make this video."
"Finished composing my ""Ode to @theemrsmcafee"". Janice managed to record the last half."
"""Just get a lawyer and resolve my issues with th U.S.""?   Don't be naive. I speak out. I recommend people use privacy coins to avoid taxes (Income tax is unconstitutional - we had none until 1913 and thrived). I lash out at our endemic corruption, etc. Lawyers can't fix this."

".@Thefotoking captures the moment we were told by Cuba that the U.S. had demanded they give us up. As a middle finger answer, Cuba allowed us 72 hours to move on instead. Next, in the D.R., the U.S tried force, but lawyers intervened. Now .... you ask why the tinfoil room??"
"The ""Great Wall"" on the Mexican border: I propose we instead build that wall around D.C. It would be 1/100th of the distance, so we could make it 100 times higher for the same cost. That's two miles high. Ain't no-one escaping from that. We'd be safe."

The FBI Has announced a crackdown on Conspiracy Theorists. Waiting for them to shut down that group of conspiracy nuts who are propagating the insane belief that Epstein killed himself.

"Our own experiences divide us, because we feel that our experiences are more valid than those of others whose experiences only slenderly touch our own. We must let others in, and not invalidate understandings that are alien to our own."
"Are we this frightened as a nation? A man says ""shoot the feds"", and is charged with a crime. I can't count the times I've heard: ""Just kill 'em all"", referencing terrorists, Muslim Extremists, criminals, pedophiles, cops, etc. Good God! You can't trade freedom for security."
"Would you think it was me if we trimmed and colored his beard, colored and re-did his hair, made a few cosmetic changes???  I'm looking for three new doubles of me. I can make this one work. Just watch."
"""Shoot the feds"" is a threat??? I see it more as exasperation. A curse phrase. An expression of extreme dislike. No specific individual, office, position or place was threatened. It is the system that is threatened. Since when did threatening a system become a crime?"

"I was stunned by Epstein's suicide, though probably not as much as Epstein himself."
"I feel for Epstein's family, but an advantage of his ""suicide"" is: there is no case, and what might have been revealed at trial goes back into a closet, never to be revealed. The result: panicked politicians can now breathe easily and comfortably return to ravaging we the people."
"Jeffrey Epstein, accused sex trafficker, dies by suicide?   Self inflicted or otherwise?   @ABC"

"Zerohedge writing about my advice for Civil War II. Why is the press being so nice? It scares me. Have been losing sleep over it. What hideous, twisted shit are they planning?"
"It's not ""The People"" against the ""Government"". The Government is composed of people. Too many people. We have a sickness. A cancerous growth. That cancerous growth is ""Unbridled Power"". Some in our Government have been consumed by it. It must be removed."

My apologies. It seems that I was trolled about Apollo. As best I can tell the company is unable to control any coins that have been issued. My bad. It's still a great coin.

People saying I'm weak and flustered. My response:
"My ""Outlaw for Freedom"" interview. One if my best I think."
It's not a crystal ball. It's common f--cking sense.
Got a background screen for my communications room. Maybe I'll look less like I'm inside a tinfoil hat when doing interviews etc:)
"Freedom Of The Press? The NYT headlined a story about Trump's speech - ""Trump Urges Unity vs Racism"". Angry Democrats forced a change in the next edition to ""Assailing Hate But Not Guns"". Our media is a tool of special interests - both Republican and Democrat."
The mass shootings. Do you have questions? I do.
My new massage chair installed in my communications room this morning. I can now accompany my paranoia with relaxation while I work:)
"BTC waking up again. Up and down but long term steady growth is apparent. The ""Thin Air"", as @realDonaldTrump calls Bitcoin, appears to have an energy based on some real substance."
"Do you yearn for freedom? This faraday cage, which is merely my communications room, in no way restricts my freedom. It is the mental cage which our government insists we live within that is the enemy to my freedom. Wake up and raise your voice."
"The Justice Department's insistence that people who do not believe in our Government's explanations, and instead believe alternate theories, ""MIGHT"" perform criminal acts, is a giant leap toward the world in ""Minority Report"" where people are arrested for their future crimes."
"The Justice Department is now one with the ""Inquisitors"" of the medieval Catholic church. They search for heretics that do not support every word of every branch of the U.S. Government - a government shrouded in secrecy and acting against its own citizens. We are the enemy."
"Believe in ""Q""? Conspiracy theories? Do you believe the Federal Government engages in ""Secret or malevolent"" acts? If so, the Justice Department can now declare you a domestic terrorist. I shit thee not."
"The Justice Department, automobiles, bank robberies, the Mob, consensual sex with whales and privacy. Ready to wake the f--ck up America?"
Finally ... the world is catching on to what I have been saying for years: We are slaves to the corporate/governmental system.

So many responses from young men already considering marriage. You need to understand that there are other options to marriage. Sawing off your leg at the knee is one such option. Use your head. You could think of others.
"Ok, Ok.. sorry  I excluded you ..  ADVICE FOR WOMEN:  - Get as much as you can from a man as early as possible - Try not to get pregnant until you are 30.  - Believe nothing a man says - practice deception. It will serve you well. - follow your heart."
Young men always asking my advice. Here it is: - Wait until you are 40 to consider marriage - Never give a woman your real name - Stay out of jail as much as possible - follow your heart
"Scammers are targetting my account, pretending to be me - offering free crypto and stuff. The only thing you'll ever get free from me, or anyone, is advice like this tweet. It's tragic: Those who actually read this don't need the advice. The idiots who need it don't read it."
A retweet from my friend Olex who slept on the floor of my hotel room in London.

"I love the media. Just because I have faraday caged communication room the press claims I'm ""holed up"" in it. If you enter your garage to do some work are you holed up in your garage? I guess I should have posted a pic of the f-king door which I use to enter and leave."
"The world is full of people with small cognitive abilities. No. We don't live in the faraday cage. It's our communications room. And none, other than my compatriots and I, know what's outside that door. Don't assume it's not tropical, or majestic mountains, or an infinite desert."
I am an escaped slave with a loud voice. All of the World's slave masters are looking for me. I will not be found. I will continue to speak. But will you listen? Will you listen?
My comments on the International day of recognition for human trafficking and slavery. You will not like them.
"I love London's ""Sun"" newspaper. It's a cross between America's ""National Enquierer"" and a news focused version of Marvel Comics. In this long story I am painted as The Joker melded with Dr. Evil - both wearing a James Bond mask. Can't get any creepier."
"Some have pointed out that a photo seems to have been taken of me while in jail, therefore an electronic device was probably present, therefore I actually could have hacked Jeffrey Epstein. Fools! A trained eye can easily spot that the photo was taken with a 1951 Kodak box camera"
This is the sort of shit my impersonator has been doing and blaming on me. How could I possibly smuggle an electronic device into a Dominican Republic jail in order to hack Epstein? Please!!!
People saying they found my imposter that's been getting me in trouble. You have found the wrong man. This man is a simple Viagra smuggler from Jamaica and is completely innocent of anything he might be charged with. Ignore him.
"RT is one of the few news outlets that totally ""gets"" my dry sense of humor. Me making fun of Me is my driest. Great article if you want a few laughs."
"People asking why I spent such a short time in jail last week for (alleged) firearms smuggling, or whatever it was. The answer is simple: I'm getting bored with jail. This time, after four days I simply decided to do something else."
.@theemrsmcafee and I in Lithuania at our secure facility. The long arm of the corrupt U.S. Justice Department does not reach here. We will relax a day or two and get back to the business of fighting injustice wherever we find it.
"Olex was one of the people who slept on the floor of our hotel room in London, where we were forced to stop for 11 hours while on our way to safety. DOJ and CIA kidnap teams were circling like vultures but we were safe with multiple witnesses. Thanks Olex and guys."
"If you see this man call the police immediately!! His is masquerading as me and running around causing all kinds of mischief and mayhem, for which I am paying the price. He is allegedly armed, dangerous and unhinged. Usually in the company of an even more dangerous black woman."
Had a great meeting with Max Cartier (r) of Vintech Capital while waiting to be detained in the D.R. Great things are coming to Crypto.
"Sorry for the silence. @theemrsmcafee and I are now in Eastern Europe at an ultra-secure facility. We are, for now, out of reach of the corrupt elements of the (In-)Justice Department. We are healthy and safe. Have missed you guys. Will tell more later."
Am back. Update in a moment.

On the move again. The long arm of the U.S. is reaching for us here in London. Thank God it's a weekend. Government bureaucracy paperwork is stalled until tomorrow morning.   We are never stalled. Will update you soon.
Everyone asking .... how did I smuggle a smart phone into jail? No body orifices were needed. It was simple sleight of hand. If my hands were bigger I could have smuggled a Bangkok prostitute in with me.
"Conspiracy theorists believe I am operating the drones taking videos of Jeffrey Epstein's island. Hate to throw water on that theory but the last video was posted while I was in jail. I'm good, but not that good."
"Our dogs are safe. The D.R. officials left them on our boat with no food, water or air conditioning for more than 60 hours but they survived. I demand an apology from this corrupt regime or I will publish the full account of our mistreatment. No one will ever visit D.R. again."
Bitcoin is under pressure from the U.S. and its price reflects it. But the U.S. has no real power in controlling CryptoCurrency. Just watch. A week from today Bitcoin will continue its meteoric rise.
Frank Felix Duran Mejia is involved with Paul Rolle in their attempt to collect me. Just spitting out names for now. Details coming soon.  There is an underground network of corrupt national officials that is used by the CIA for nefarious purposes. I will soon illuminate it.

".@realDonaldTrump:  I pray that you were unaware of what the CIA and your runaway ""Justice"" Department have been orchestrating in order to silence my CryptoCurrency views. If a sitting President would turn his head from such a monumental travesty of Justice then America is lost."
"If the Dominican Republic harms a single hair on any of my dogs that they forced @theemrsmcafee and myself to separate from, then, yes, wrath will rain down from heaven."
"Besides Paul Rolle's involvement from the Bahama's, two other Bahamians have been involved in attempts to apprehend me. First is Carlton Butler (below right) and his father, Samuel Butler. More on each coming soon."
The issue we now have is that the D.R. has not returned our dogs to us. We were not allowed to leave anyone in our boat to care for them when we were deported. The D.R. government took custody and we've heard nothing. If they were harmed I will work to ensure D.R. tourism ends.
Why were we detained?   Allegedly for not declaring our firearms. Firearms are legal on yachts but must be declared to customs. Our weaons displayed ready to declare. We were never allowed to declare because we were boarded and detained before we were allowed to speak to customs.
"Got sleep for the first time since being shaken down by the D.R. government. The man responsible for this is Paul Rolle, the corrrupt Bahamian head of police. I earlier outed his secret dealings. They were never investigated by Bahamian authorities. So I will be revealing more."
"We are in london. A different world from the Chaos of the D.M. Tomorrow I will lay out how an extremely corrupt Bahamian Official orchestrated our ordeal, with the help of the CIA. I will bring him down first, then decide what to do next. Full videos, texts and voice recordings."
"""Rob Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Loggia-Ramirez""! The press, without any thought, regurgitates whatever nonsense it is fed. In spite of the addition of ""Maria"" to the garble he constantly changes when asked his name, my campaign manager and deep friend, Rob Loggia, was believed"
And.... oddly enough .... @theemrsmcafee and myself will be in London tonight if any of you British folks would like to dissuade me from embarking upon this madness.
"Given that there are no laws in either country explicitly stating that the country's leader cannot also be the leader of another country, and given that this concept is no more absurd than the existing two party system dividing both countries down the middle, should I go for it?"
"Can a person run for, and be, President of the United States and Prime Minister of Great Britain simultaneously? Yes. Absolutely. Without question. But I believe I am one of the few people stil alive who could qualify for the combined position."
From CBS News about the arrests of myself and my team in the D.R. This is a fine example of media nonsense and propaganda fed by a need to be first with a story and a need to sensationalize.
The dude they were looking for is on the left. The dude that did the time is on the right.
"I was jailed, with @theemrsmcafee and our crew, for all but 1 hour of our visit to the D.R. The story is too complex to quickly tell, but in a nutshell, the Authorities deeply suspected that I was actually John McAfee. ."

"I Am a presidential candidate with 1.2 mil followers. My crime is not filing tax returns - not a crime. The rest is propaganda by the U.S. government to silence me. My voice is the voice of dissent. If I am silenced, dissent itself will be next."

"This is @Loggiaonfire speaking for @officialmcafee:  For reasons beyond his control, JM will be going dark on Twitter once again. Nothing more can be said ATM; updates will be provided once available."
Bitcoin's price dipped after Trump's negative tweet. Proof that few in the investment community understand even the the basic principles of Crypto. The existing power structure is powerless to influence Crypto  - which is a mathematical system operating outside of power itself.
"The U.S. cannot even ban weed - after 70 years of trying. How can a country ban the use of privacy coins like Monero or Apollo, when used on truly distributed exchanges. Banning the invisible, used by the anonymous. Wake up world! Crypto is the mythical Pandora's box come to life"
India announces it plans to ban all crypto. Banning mosquitos after a rain in the summer would stand a better chance of being enforceable.
White Supremacy? Immigration? Intolerance? Anger? WhT's really happening here?
"Crypto has now threatened our government so much that it has become a ""National Security"" issue. The ""security"" threatened is not that of our nation's citizens, but that of the corrupt government that has enslaved us."

Jeffrey Eptstein's fake passport: i told him to pay a few dollars more at Guido's.
Let's get our timelines straight. The headline in my prior tweet about seeking asylum in Guatemala has nothing to do with my current war with the U S. Government. It's from seven years ago and relates to an entirely different story.
Trump announces major crackdown on asylum seekers. I hope there's a statute of limitations. Only been 7 years for me.

"The altcoin world wondering what to buy. Vertical markets don't vary. A medical company in the Crypto world will mirror its fiat counterpart.  Med companies are the big winners, always. Privacy coins, in a world of crypto transparency likewise can't lose. use your heads."
Bitcoin is at the mid 10's and people worry. LMFAO!! Why do you pay attention to weekly fluctuations? Look at the past few months FFS! It's rising drastically. I'm still positive about my $1 mil BTC price by the end of 2020. Alt coins like MTC and Apollo will rise ten times more.
At a cockfight. Americans will scream. But I saw slaughterhouses in Denver where brains are bashed with sledgehammers; Tyson farms where billions of poultry live a life of brutality; and the MMA where humans bleed at another's hands. We need to look in the mirror before we judge.

The Fed warns Facebook. Trump warns everybody. The SEC files lawsuits. The fear of Crypto is striking home.
"My tweets opposing Trump's dislike if crypto in no way means that I dislike Trump. I am certain that who ever was sitting in the oval office, they would have been convinced by the CIA, the IRS, the SEC and other corrupt agencies within our government that Crypto is evil."

Crypto facilitates unlawful activities like the drug trade??? I thought the current $200 billion drug trade was priced in U.S. dollars and paid for by same?? I'm going to feel so foolish on discovering the actual currency for purchasung drugs is  bananas or Soy Milk.

A blatant example of U.S. Government lies about me. Sputnik news asked the IRS about my claims that they wanted me. They denied it. Below are screenshots of the Sputnik article and images of their Grand Jury documents asking for indictment. Wake up America!
What is real people? Pleasing the world around you to gain favor? Walking the straight and narrow out of fear? Believing lies to avoid facing the truth? Look at the reality of what our country has become. Can any favor or security be worth this for your children?
"I'm sure everyone has noticed the plague of scammers targetting my account. I report every one. If you would all do the same maybe Twitter would wake up and do something. Click the down arrow at right if the scam. Click ""it's spam, and then ""Uses reply function to spam"". Simple."
"Yes, I've been underspeaking. People accuse me of exaggeration, so this a reverse tactic. Yes, I invented the term ""underspeak"", as in ""He underspoke WWII when he described it as a neighborly dispute"". it is not the same as understatement, which is merely a minor unexaggeration."
"Trashed because I ""promote""   Get real people. It's an experiment FFS! I'm interested to see what happens with a hyper-deflationary coin. And stop saying it's been done before! Who cares? The airplane went through 200 years of trials before flying!"
Here's a new one: College kids and developers have designed a social experiment around a coin called Fuze   It's hyper-deflationary - meaning 5% of each transaction is burned on the blockchain. The supply constantly decreases. Should be fascinating to watch

"Some say my self imposed exile to Cuba, where I am running my Campaign for U.S. President, might be viewed by the U.S. Government as agression against them. If I chose to be aggressive, there would be no question. It would be fucking clear."

"After dinner cigars. I chose a Monte Christo #2. @Thefotoking chose a Partegas (Too high end for me), and @theemrsmcafee chose a Cohiba Robusto. The conversation meandered into the realm of Politics and my Presidential Campaign. We all know I have no chance. It doesn't matter."
"Dinner at Area 53, Havana. The fruit plate contains: mango, passion fruit, cubed watermelon and pineapple. Fucking delicious."
"My Government resents my speaking about its hypocrisies, lies, deceits and manipulations. It wants me to stand down. I have not, so it has exaggerated my small legal rebellions into high crimes. This is what happens when Free Speech in America is directed against the government."
"I want to help the Cuban people - against Congressional laws and Administrative decrees. The Government knows better, people insist. My actions are treasonous, they say. I'm not so sure. I follow my heart. I have no other guide. Does our government even have a heart to follow?"

Even a Vietnamese publication has picked up the story about my Crypto development offer to Cuba. Amost half the countries in the world have now written about it but the media in my own country remains silent. Ask yourself why! @DiazCanelB @CubaMINREX
I'm losing followers because I support the Cuban Crypto concept. I am campaigning against the U.S. desire to police the world - we have problems at home. Why is it inconsistent to defeat U.S. economic sanctions against Cuba through Cuba's use of Crypto?  @DiazCanelB @CubaMINREX

"Tired of hearing ""If we don't have an income tax how do we fund the government?"" The U.S. had no income tax til 1913, FFS! For 150 years we were thriving. Lot's of countries have no income tax and thrive. 1,000s of ways to fund a government. Income taxation is the most cruel."

"And a suggestion: improve your tradecraft! Driving slowy past, then doing a u-turn in the middle of the road and repeating over and over hardly qualifies as covert. I suggest you drive past my field of vision, swap cars and hope I don't have spotters scattered around the Marina."
To @CIA: the red Peugeot whose diplomatic plates I photo'd yesterday and published has not shown up again. Thank you. But the gray one persists. If I see it again I will publish those plates too. The Burkina Fosi government can't be very pleased with you.
Please understand the U.S. Government's insanity: It's clear that toilets shipped to Cuba will only gain U.S. approval if the toilet seats are removed. The purpose is to humiliate. Let me tell you . . . . . . It isn't working. 63 years of this. Christ!!!! Wake up America!!
We don't have a homeless problem in America?????? Has no-one bothered to look under a bridge?!
"You bash me for supporting the Cuban people. Yes - there are few luxuries here. But there's no scarcity of basic foodstuffs, clothing and housing. Seems to me the Cuban Government has their priorities straight. We have millions of homeless in the U.S. Are our priorities straight?"
"The 60+ year economic blockade of Cuba by the U.S. did weird stuff. Basic food suppliers, and some others, ignored U.S. threats. Others quaked in fear and obeyed. No one, for example, even fancy places, can obtain toilet seats. The U.S. clearly is the toilet seat god of the world"

"My last appeal to the CIA: I am a patriotic American. I have broken no law except my refusal to file tax returns (not even a felony), and a drunk driving. You, in co-operation with the FBI, have manufactured crimes against me. I am running for President. You don't like my views?"
"One of the cars following us belongs to the Burkina Faso Embassy in Cuba. Oddly, the U.S. gave substantial support to the winning party in the last elections in the country. I think this establishes the CIA connection I was looking for. Tomorrow I will have all documentation."

One thing more for the CIA operating illegally in Cuba: Disable the garbage spyware you have pushed down to my phone. It is 2 generations old and functions poorly on an S10. I can now only make one call without having to power off and on again and it interferes with my VPN.
"We are constantly tailed while in Cuba. Always, the cars have diplomatic plates. Diplomats have better things to do, unless they're the CIA, who operate even in non USA Embassies. This is annoying me. I'm 74 with naught to lose. I will out you with full documentation. End it!"
"Cuba is planning to use Cryptocurrency to get around the 63 years of economic strangulation imposed upon 14 million Cuban people by the insanity of the US Government. Finally, a large scale, real world application for Cryptocurrencies. If Cuba wants my help, I am here."

American cars in Cuba are all pre-1957 - and they are the most common cars on the road. It's like being in a time warp. The dashboards are fascinating. This 1953 Buick has two ashtrays. One for the driver and one for the passenger. Makes me want to smoke two cigarettes at once.
People who are apathetic toward the corruption in our Government are not victims of the system. They are accomplices.

"Will it continue? Of course. Will it reverse? Of course, but briefly. In the long run Bitcoin will break records that will only be exceeded by alt coins, a phenomenon that will go down in history as the single most important economic upheaval since the invention of minted coins."
"I predicted the start of the Bull Market and also stated ""The further back an arrow is drawn, the faster it will fly"". If this arrow us not flying fast then you are in an alternate universe. And the universe of alt coins will soon eclipse what you are seeing with Bitcoin."
"The prices of many solid alt coins were hit ten times as bad as Bitcoin during the Bear market, yet many are based on sound economics, especially in the Medical field and in the Privacy coins which we all know will be the big winners. Privacy coins are the future."
Alt coin prices to surge ten times faster than Bitcoin:
"Bitcoin cranking up, but the real winners, beginning soon, pwill be the alt coins 10x + the rise in Bitcoin. Top of the heap will be the ones most beaten down in the Bear Market - Docademic, Apollo, XTZ, etc. This is where the real money is to be made. Fill your bags folks."

Lucky people. You are getting to watch a Spy Thriller unfold before your eyes. @britbonglogpost is getting a glimpse into the daily reality of my life:
"People beg: ""Release more!"" Every time I do I pay dearly, as this front page article last week in the Bahamian Guardian shows. Please understand: the having of the data and not releasing it till I'm gone is all that's keeping me alive. Stand up yourself and do something FFS!!"
Why am I keeping this information private if it could help the world? Because I am a dead man the moment it is released. Forgive my selfishness. I am doing what I can in ways that a living person can do. That will have to be enough. I am old. You will not have long to wait.
Why would someone out themselves as having copies of my information? Think people. If I disappear it is suspicious. If we both disappear it is obvious. Salute the man for bravery.
"I outed CIA agent Kent, Commissioner Rolle and Tellis Bethel. I did this to prove I have data. It keeps me alive. See this. If I go, people in other countries have this data and will release it. One, in England, wants to be named. His reasons. You are brave @britbonglogpost."

A message to me from the CIA
Patryk Labus also hospitalized. That makes all 6 of my International Managers for my 2020 Presidential campaign hospitalized in the past week. In six different countries. Plus one of my body doubles - Jay Pizzle - and my head of security - Bruce Heidelberg. Wake up America!!!!
What is the purpose of verification? It's to provide assurance that who we are interacting with is really who we think! Please God! Anyone who believes that a check mark is a sign of recognition has never sent Bitcoins to a fake John McAfee. Verify O.J. for crying out loud!
You ask how you can help me. This once you can. I'm asking your help in spreading this image as widely as possible. @money_alotta put his soul into this work and it reflects my situation and my message with more power than words could say. Do me this one favor. Please.
Here's a more detailed version of @money_alotta's masterpiece in case anyone wants to make a poster etc.
"I would like to acknowledge @winklevoss as the true power within the Winklevoss Twins. While Tyler (@tylerwinklevoss) does have more followers (purchased from a bot company), Cameron's power is reflected in the fact that he doesn't even need a first name in his Twitter handle:)"
From my good friend and fellow party animal @tylerwinklevoss. Thank you Tyler. @benmezrich
"The CIA's tradecraft is stuck in the 1950's, with a 2nd grade addition of electronics and a kindergarten addition of Social Engineering. This is why I am certain it is the CIA following me. Reminds me of Russian spys following people in cars grinding the first gear."
"Another issue I just received permission to disclose: @KryptoExile - my head of U.S. Security, left the Behamas just before we escaped into Cuba. When he arrived in the U.S. he fell ill with an undiagnosed ailment and was hospitalized. Bruce. Then Jay. Coincidence?"
I have offered a dozen times to assist the CIA to bring their digital sciences into the modern age. Every time I have been turned down. I have no sympathy for their lack of security and incompetence. I could have made them iron clad. Too late now.
"*Security = ""Stability"". Sorry for the small mistake."
"Wow!! I just made the ""Threats To America's Digital Presence And Security List""! It's a well known, almost public list which the CIA believes is a closely guarded secret. We won't tell them though. Good. They have not yet discovered the Social Media Dark World:)"
"You say: ""what about lack of freedoms in Cuba?"". What lack of freedoms? You know only the propaganda you are fed by the media - the mouthpiece of the US Givernment. If you have not seen a thing with your own eyes, you cannot trust what you know. Stop being sheep. Wake up!"
"More bleatings of ""Just because I don't see the cameras in Cuba doesn't mean they are not there"". Please people. I am John Fucking McAfee - one oqf the leading cybersecurity experts in the world. Try hiding a fucking camera from me."
"Bleatings of ""Cuba is not a free country"" from sheep in a country with video cameras on every corner, in every public place, in every government building. In two weeks I have not seen a single video camera anywhere in Cuba. Wake up people. Stop the U.S. government's propaganda."
"People saying: ""Just pay your income taxes and come home"". Fuck no!!  Income taxation is unconstitutional. Stop believing that caving in will solve our problems! It merely magnifies them!"
"Naivete, our government and 1970 porno films."
Some suggest I take up residence in one of the Embassies here in Havana for safety. I won't do that. I couldn't roam free. My entire being balks at the concept of trading freedom for security. It is what the U.S. Government has demanded of us for years. Just say no!
The CIA tries to silence me. I escape. One of my many body doubles disapears on the way to do a keynote as me. He wakes up 11 days later with no memory. Hospital says he was poisoned  wake up America!
.@JayPizzle88 in the hospital. He was to keynote as my body double on the Blockchain Cruise two weeks ago. He just woke up. He was poisoned. Please people. WAKE THE FUCK UP!! Our government is a monster. They are trying to silence me. Stop trolling me and see the truth!!!
Spoke with @JayPizzle88. Last thing he remembers: the evening before he was to leave from N.Y. to Barcelona to meet the Blockchain Cruise. He was to deliver the Keynote speech as my body double. He wakes up 11 days later in hospital after poisoning by unknown substance. Please!!!
Jay Pizzle has been found. He was unconscious for days. The CIA has some serious drugs:) Here is his message.

My morning harrassment of our government being carried out in the Hemingway Cafe under a rare photo of Hemingway with the young Castro.
"The U.S. Government claims that Cuba - this poor, economically strangled island on which I am standing - is a destabilizing influence. Bullshit!  ""I"" am a destabilizing influence!!! ""Stability"" means the perpetuation of rampant corruption in our Gov. It needs to be destabilized."
"Nothing to do but watch movies during the 40 hours. As Usual, Marley (tallest dog on record) taking up the entire room."

Going dark now. All is well. See you folks in a couple of days.
"Any information you may have on CIA backed ""Project Canister"" is of great interest to me. The program targets governance dissidents (Assange, Withers, the ""Jester"", maybe me, etc). We need to remove the veil of secrecy from all such programs. Free America!"
Many suggest I document my life. Award winning videographer @Thefotoking has been filming and photographing my meagre existence for seven years. He tells me he can't finish because each day gets more interesting. I think he's just lazy:)
Beginning today at around 10:00 AM EST I will be going dark for at least 48 hours. Do not be concerned by my absence.
We spoke with Jay the night before he was supposed to leave. All was fine and he was excited to go on the cruise. His flight was to leave the following morning. We know only that he did not show up for his flight and he was not seen at the airport.
My tweet about the disappearance of one of my body doubles -  @JayPizzle88 - was met with many jokes. I blocked everyone who joked. Any pleas for re-instatement will fall on deaf ears.Trolling is one thing. Indifference toward your fellow human will not be tolerated on my page.

A clip of a conversation this afternoon between ex-CIA station head Robert David Steele and myself. If anyone doubts my dark mood please read this:
"Many people were perturbed by my calling @theemrsmcafee ""My Bitch"". I apologize if I offended anyone's sensibilities, but in the culture that Janice came from, and the culture I most closely  identify with, the word ""bitch"" bears an appropriate and loving connotation. That's all."
"My bitch is the finest woman I have ever met. Her brilliance, street smarts and ladyballs exceed my own. I love you @theemrsmcafee"
"On Friday, I will release the names of 25 Congressmen and 5 Senators, from both Parties, who are coming up for re-election in 2020, and who MUST be recalled, and if that fails, booted out of office on election day. Power corrupts, and corruption is the enemy of Freedom."
"All I wanted was to be left alone. I paid tens of millions of dollars in taxes ane received only the condescension of Federal employees, when i needed services, in return. I chose to pay no more. This is my crime. You should have left me alone."
Coming soon at the (almost) open @officialmcafee / @money_alotta  Merch Store.

A photomontage put together by @Thefotoking from our excursion yesterday.
Our evening excursion yesterday with just the boys. @theemrsmcafee was in Nassau so we were free to cut loose:}
"The first real interview I've had in a long time. Most are just rehashes of my tweets. This one asked the questions that everyone should be asking about me, the future of Cryptocurrency and what we all need to do to get universal acceptance."
"At Choppy's bar with @Thefotoking and @CorySeagris discussing reasons for the tongue. Agreed on 3: speech, manager of chewing, and taste - (so we don't poison ourselves)  We denied pleasure as we could find no evolutionary advantage to it. But this conch salad is better than sex."
"My campaign: our current government is doing everything to try to restrict and control cryptocurrencies. But this powerful tool, combined with a will to use it for it's intended purpose, can free us. A TRUE government would do everything within its power to free it's people."

"Don't forget - Sundays at 2:00 Eastern: ""kicking it with Da McAfees"". 2nd episode coming this Sunday - ""The General of Exuma, and How to Eat Pussy"". Trailer coming soon."
"The right to privacy is the basis of freedom. Governments argue that they need to see into their citizen's lives. Wrong! Governments are OF the People, not the reverse. We must return to a world where governments are fully transparent, and citizens have complete privacy."
"Governments are moving to ban privacy coins, but these laws have no teeth. Weed is restricted almost everywhere, but people still smoke. Laws that cannot be enforced are baseless laws - designed to protect governments from citizens. They are corrupt laws."
"I abandoned whale fucking when I finally accepted the fact that, never, remotely, could it compete with this:    via @YouTube"
No person in power within our governmentcan can fix corruption. They are enmeshed in the system and a corrupt system can only beget more corruption. It must be fixed from without - by we the people.
Trump is neither the problem nor the savior. We created this dystopia called America. The apathy toward the corruption and misconduct of the people we put in power is ours.
Does it matter whether trump is impeached? It is the war between our two parties that matters. There is no resolution that will end this war. The root cause is the disconnect between the people and our government.

".@Thefotoking is producing the only authorized documentary of my life. He has been following me around since 2012 - in Belize. He asks me odd questions, which I always answer. Here is a snippet from the movie where he asks me about the Bible - a book that I seldom reference."

"Let me simplify: our government is corrupt. Ignoring this will turn us all into slaves. If someone has a gun to your head, you are free to close your eyes and pretend that all is fine. But all is not fine. A bullet is coming."
I resign from the human race. I chastise people for their complacency - ignoring the implications of the U.S. Government's IP blocking and instead suggesting VPNs as a go around. As if that would fix the root problem! My chastisement is then used for asking about VPNs. I give up
Satoshi is the White Paper  author. That's who we're looking for. Authorship forensics is therefore 100% applicable. Run such software against other things Craig Wright wrote. It will prove that he is not the author. Do the same for all candidates. You will find Satoshi.
"Dear God people! I tweet about the US Government being lumped in with rogue and terrorist nations for its fear based Internet policies toward Crypto. Your unbelievable complacency ignores the horrifying implications and instead says: ""Use a VPN"". Please.  . . . Wake the fuck up!"
"The U.S. joins Somalia, Iran, Libya, and other rogue nations as being undesirable Internet users. The world is now seeing our government for what it is. Need more? The barbaric ""Grand Jury"" was abandoned by every principled country in the world except Lybia and the U.S. Wake up!"

Our next poster is dedicated to @bitcoinbella_ .  Thank you @money_alotta
Love?? God himself could not explain it in words. Love is felt through the heart - through sensation. Through touch' sight' sound' taste. This is my description:
KBC Coin. An awesome read:
"We don't need to be told the value of a dollar. Our awareness of value comes from knowing the dollar price of goods and services. In crypto we don't need exchanges to tell us value. The economy itself could be our guide. But first, we must use crypto as intended. Why wait? Use it"
Oops. Accidently deleted:  THE MCAFEE FREEDOM COIN:
Traders view the crypto trading market as the gauge of a coin's value. This is a fallacy. True value comes from the market of goods and services exchanged through crypto. The influence of this market will soon outweigh the market on which we now depend. Change is coming
Bitcoin vs gold. Like comparing fishing reels to Swedish massage. A pointless exercise.
.@theemrsmcafee is becoming a photographer in her own right.
Our next poster is dedicated to @MrMichaelNye.  @money_alotta manifested this remotely by hacking into a Bitmain S9 miner and reprogramming to hash colors.
"The difference between gold and Bitcoin? Gold is a commodity, occupying space, with mass, temperature, shape. Bitcoin is an idea, made manifest through a series of numbers, with no true location or substance - a clever concept with infinite fluidity. To compare them is madness."
Please folks the previous tweet was not entirely serious.
"People ask: ""Where are we headed""?  We are creating the currencies that soon to be AI systems will use as value scales after we have been anihlated by them."
Proof of @Thefotoking's legendary talents. I have worked exclusively with Robert for 8 years.
"Crypto is pure math. Coins created by hashing or other algorithms. Moved under control of math logic. They're fractionalized, stored, retrieved, exchanged under control of formulas. Coins are electronic elements of a vast system controlled by math. This is not the Stock Market."
I'm not the only madman in crypto apparently. $1 mil prediction by 2021 by the man who has never been wrong in his predictions.. 2021 us just one day away from my prediction  of $1 mil by 12/31/2020.
My California fan club wants a plaster cast of my d***k for posterity in case I lose my bet. I'm weighing the posterity thing against simply keeping its memory alive in the minds of the few thousands of women who have known it and are certain to pass down stories. Thoughts?

"Yes. The card is accepted everywhere that Visa or Mastercard are accepted. The U.S., Europe, Russia, China, Tierra del Fuego - everywhere. No restrictions."
One thing I forgot to mention about my upcoming Visa/Mastercard Crypto Debit Card: I retain the privacy and anonimity inherent in Crypto. We ask only what name you want on the card and  what address you want it shipped to. P.O. boxes are acceptable.
"Doge started life as joke/prank coin. The coin now has a market cap of $360 mil. The crypto market is, in no way, related to the stock market. Inherent value is, ultimately, based on usage. Doge is one of the fastest growing coins based on use. Go figure."
"People keep asking what I am worth. The answer:  My net worth has been zero for almost 8 years. It has not fluctuated. I may temporatily have cash or assets in my possession  but they are loans or the equivalent of escrow deposits. I own nothing but my clothes, eyeglasses, etc."
"Thanks to artist @Thefotoking and to an amazingly bright human - Porn Rapper @mrpimp_dog, for noting the extremes of my madness and my rare epiphanies. Costs 52 seconds. No exceptions. Engineers working on a means of reducing your time costs while providing an identical product"

"Lot's of ""deepfake"" references in my last post. You have no idea. I hope you understand that anyone who would be concerned about a fake porn video, etc., has to be fake themselves. If you go deep enough into this mystery you will be staring into the abyss."
"Me, in my latest disguise."
"Had deep discussions on the boat tonight. Peple asking deep questions, like what their purpose in life may be.  Do you know yourself? In your entirety? If not, then how can you ask what someone's purpose in life may be if you don't know that someone?"

"Cory took this photo as we were leaving for our beach-side breakfast on a nearby island. It looks like we're having fun but we're not. Don't think about abandoning your exciting office jobs, your glorious commutes, your yardwork, maintenance etc. We wish we had your life."
"Bitcoin mixers are now being targeted. Anonymity itself is slowly being considered a crime. The word ""Privacy"" will soon mean ""Criminal Intent""."
"People saying only humans understand fair play, and only humans show consideration. . . . . . Wrong!"
We opened up the company's Atomic Wallet this morning and our entire Tezos holdings had vanished - not even a transaction history existed. Emailed their support and received an anwer within ten minutes. Problem was taken care of. Wish eveyone provided such support. Thanks Atomic.

Short term versus long term investing.
"Got lots of comments about KBC coin being a scam. Please!!! Yes when their wallet first came out prior to their $100 mil ICO, it had a serious bug. However, no one who saved their private key and mnemonic lost a dime. It was only those who failed to do so who lost money."
Oops!! Left out the company's website:
"WARNING: i work with this company. However, I only work for companies I believe in.  KBC coin is linked to gold in a way that downside is limited, while upside is unlimited.  For me it is simply a way to protect against the crypto markets' volatility."
Damn!!! My lawnmower mechanic was going to file a copyright for the same paper next week. I told him he should have acted sooner.

"Exuma is surrounded by beautiful water. I chose this place for two reasons: 1. No income tax. Tax related crimes in the US are not crimes here, therefore extradition is not possible by international treaty. 2. Because Exuma is the most beautiful island on the face of this planet."

What is liberty?
"Hatred defines an extremist. But which of you can distinguish hatred from outrage? From passion caused by injustice? By just plain anger? It is hatred if focused on an entity with which you sympathize. If focused on your enemy, it is merely revenge."
"Who decides what is an extremist? What are the parameters - social, political, cultural? Even if parameters existed, would they not change drastically with each regime change? Please, see where this is headed. If we open this door then the only extremist will be our government."

The U.S. Gov. thinks it's watching me. I'm the master of disinformation and obfuscation. Must be in.order to make McAfee Inc fight an army of hackers. It is me that is watching the U.S. Gov.  You will soon see the truth. Silence me and hundreds will cintinue to release the Truth.
"The IRS, using the NSA and the FBI, are harrassing my former employees (Two were given houses), my business contacts (In Mexico no less), my banks, and even my auto mechanics. I will be publishing the full audio of these harrassments soon. I invented the tech they use. I'm McAfee"
"Please! Those who claim Satoshi is Paul Solotshi Calder Le Roux, have been smoking way too much opium!"
Nuff said.
My thoughts on distributed exchanges:
"Stocks have only a market created face value. Cryptocurrencies have a face value + a functional value. The net functional value is now near zero -  little use of a token's utility, but functional growth rate will soon reach exponential values. There will be an ecplosion soon."
"The more Bitcoin drops in price, the greater the upward acceleration when the downward pressure fizzles out. Remember - the Crypto market is NOT the stock market. It is a new paradigm. Old formulas cannot be applied, and traditional math is impotent when peering into crypto."
"Do not, under any crcumstances, panic at any drop in price, sudden or otherwise. Surely I have demonstrated that short term fluctuations have absolutely no meaning. Just check the price once every two or three months if you want to be pleased each time you check."
No words necessary.
"For those who say I live free: Freedom cannot be experienced through words, photos or videos. It must happen spontaneously by passing through those few doors left open by the free. Come and join us! You all know where I am."
.@theemrsmcafee and myself celebrating mother's day in the deck at Choppy's bar in Georgetown. We had a great day.
"It's hilarious how people look at a few hours change in the market and somehow believe it matters. Last night the headlines were Bitcoin FALLS below $7,000. This morning - $7,400. Long term is all there is folks."
And this gem - the night we arrived in our chosen Exile spot.
"I just discovered this gem from @Thefotoking, featuring @theemrsmcafee letting it all hang out."
"I have no clue who started the ""Legend"" title. It certainly wasn't me. I've always believed a person has to be dead to claim it. I would not tempt fate to that extent."
Closing in. I will not publish names or any othe vital data. Only picturesque photos.
"Hats off to Dr. Adam Back and Gavin Andresen for jointly bringing us the magic of Bitcoin. Humanity was given a new branch of social/economic possibilities with the emergence of this technology. Can we, as a society, fulfill it's promise?"
Happy Mother's Day all you Moms. Where would we be without you?  I boated @theemrsmcafee over to Blu On The Water on Stockton island - evading for the moment my annoying followers. I brought my security folks with me. They are to keep annoying people away from me. Don't test them
"Broke $7,000. The price barriers every naysayer analyst posts are merely pipe dreams for short sellers. This growth, as I predicted, will not stop."
"Have had lots of comments like this one and even @jack weighed in. I have to withdraw my bounty for identifying the gentleman in the photo. As to posting other photos, I will attempt to befriend them and then post their photos like I post photos of other friends."
"Ok. I hear you. I withdraw ny request for SS# and address (I already have both on the others). I will settle for a name. If Twitter bans me for asking help in identifying a stalker, then Twitter and the US Government have become one."
I will be getting restraining orders agsinst all of them (except the guy in the previous photo whose name I have not discovered).
"Tomorrow I will post the photos of all the idiots I've noticed. Will run a contest for my hacker followers - who first finds full names, addresses and social security numbers of all of them. I will publish the results, and invite the winner to visit here in the Bahamas."
These are the types if idiots they send: Long sleeve shirts in Tropical heat. Stood for over an hour in the same spot observing the boat. I've identified 4 of them so far. If there are more I'll have photos and IDs tomorrow. Couldn't ID this man (grainy photo). Anyone know him?

"We are starving for wisdom, yes. But does that wisdom belong in a government controlled by the people? No. Wisdom must remain with the people."
It's crazy to dump the experienced and bring in the inexperienced? What experience do they really have? Is it not experience in serving themselves? In stealing from the people? In deception and lies? Is that the experience we want? No. We must have new blood.

"To my government: you are not America - not our country. You are the custodians of our country. You are servants of the people, who chose you to serve us. Fucking act like it!"
"To the IRS, the SEC, the FBI and NSA: you are festering pustules on the face of America. Are you angry yet? God Almighty I hope so. I pray for an angry oponent. Think you know where I am - with your spyware and all? LMFAO! I am waiting to document, for the world, your corruption"
"Those who believe I am imagining all this: keep commuting to your offices, spend 9 hours in a cubicle, commuting home. 5 days a week. For 40 years. Getting your reality from TV, and your opinions from others. You cannot conceive of my life."
"If I am gone I will not be silenced. The people who assist me will be posting my pre-tweets - my thousands of tweets  anticipating my government's actions. And the hundreds who will got to the press, with the same daily texts if my Twitter is stopped. They cannot silence us all."
"If I am physically silenced, my words will continue. I have, over the past two years, prepared over 2,000 short statements covering what I anticipate will happen. If my Twitter is shut down, these statements will be delivered to the press, one at a time. You will know it is me:)"
.@theemrsmcafee has discovered the prick who is after me:)
"I expect the U.S. government to act soon in order to silence me. I want you all to know that everything I have done, I have done for the cause of freedom. I want a world in which authorities discover crimes, not manufacture them. A free world."

Want to read the best analysis ever of why the SEC has no business meddling with cryptocurrencies? This was sent to me by a man in Texas who has been incarcerated for violating SEC security laws.
There is resistence to my Bitcoin price prediction. It is because people are applying the paradigm of the traditional stock market formulas to the crypto market. Only an idiot could miss the fact that the crypto market is a brand new paradigm unto itself . Are we all that stupid?

"The laws in Cuba are extreme, but you can't claim ignorance of the law. Signs similar to this are everywhere, even in bathrooms and places that sell pets - your rights and obligations as an animal owner. Haven't delved into prostitution yet but I bet the rules are fascinating."
"Government's are collections of people occupying positions within the government's structure. The structure of our government is near perfect, but the occupiers are treating their positions as territories captured in a war. They must be thrown out. Every last one."
The power of our government is immense and a large part of that power is focused on us - the people. They want to inspire fear in order to better control us. In truth it is our government who should fear us. We are it's creator.
"The government is not your country. It is the caretaker of your country. If you loved your country just a fraction of the love you have for others, you would demand a new caretaker."
Cuba is my first Communist experience. Everyone is controlled. Permits are required for every occupation. Spy cameras are everywhere. The Government takes 30% of every peso earned. They control what you are allowed to ingest. There is no freedom. Sound familiar?
In my previous tweet I listed some of the soul crushing conditions in Cuba that no one would want live with. Yet every item on the list was the same or worse in the US. No one noticed. Can you really be this blind about the reality of your own lives? Please. Wake up!!!!!

I believe that most of you want a small change here and there - not a transformation that returns our government to sanity. You want nothing that disturbs the status quo of your existence. You want a better life without feeling it.
"Our government does not want, and in fact suppresses, free thinking individuals. It wants individuals who accept what they are told."
"There are two types of government: those that are imposed upon us with the aid of military or other means, and democracies that citizens create. The first imposes its will. They are the masters.The second carries out the will of the people. Those are servants. Do you feel served?"
I am right now staying less than a quarter of a mile from Craig's partner - Calvin Ayre. I strongly recommend that Craig stop by for a cup of tea so he can expound on that statement in person.
"Our system of education is broken. Our Government desires to teach our young what to think. But should they not be learning ""how"" to think? Carefully crafted facts, distorted or otherwise, control the ""what"". Freedom of thought, based on objective reasoning, shows them the ""how""."
"A bus line.  A one way local fare can cost $1 yet the average wage in Cuba is $20 per week. Doctors make no more than street sweepers. In spite of the economy, food shortages, restaurant menus in which 90% of the dishes are not available, the people are the friendliest on earth."
"We toured the Cohiba Cigar factory today. This lady is separating a compressed pack of 1,000 cigar leaves."
Our first outing in Cuba: 1. @theemrsmcafee taking a photo of me taking a photo of her in Guardalavaca 2. Awesome cars parked in el Centro 3. @theemrsmcafee posing 4. Typical Cuban public art
Jaguar Land Rover will be including IOTA Crypto wallets in all of their cars. This is just the beginning my friends.
Those who say I only appeal to a  narrow band of the population: the two back to back followers below seem to counter that argument:
"Governments rule through the imposition of ""authority"", but all authority destroys individual freedom. You must learn to be your own authority if you yearn for freedom."
"Governments want efficient workers, not human beings. Humans become dangerous to governments. This is why governments seek to control education, information and legislation aimed at the individual."
Yes. I discussed the price of pussy in my prior post and I'm running for President. You got a problem? Deal with it.
"Considering travel to Cuba? Consider this:  - Posession of any quantity of weed: 25 years in prison.  - Asking someone how you can buy weed: 3 years in prison.  On the up side - a full body massage at a high end hotel is $25 and pussy (forgive me, my female followers) is $30/hr."
"The road to our stranded boat: The parts for our disabled engine are in the U.S., but they can't be shipped to Cuba because the relations between the U.S. and Cuba are more broken than our engine. They tell me it will be months before we can receive them. Welcome to reality!"
Where else in the world can you be a passenger in a 1956 Ford and watch a 1953 Chevy pass an 1800's vintage horse and carriage?
"Me, exiting our taxi - a 1956 Chevy."
We had engine trouble and had to cripple into Cuba. There are no American cars in Cuba that are newer than 1956. It's like being in a time warp. Drinks are great btw.
"Sorry - ""Credit Card"" was a misnomer. More like a debit card. You load it with Bitcoin then use it anywhere. We convert to local currencies."
"P.S.  Only the first 12,000 have my image on it. After that, all cards shipped will be plain. My haters will have to wait."
A teaser for what is coming soon: The first crypto credit card accepted EVERYWHERE!
My interview with Last American Vagabonds
Our brave Nicaraguan Captain. Little does he know:)
"We are leaving for Jamaica and from there: Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Jamaica, Haiti and more. I'll be meeting with my international Campaign Managers and speaking to their citizens.  This will take many months and I will be out of touch for days at  time. Don't panic:)"

"The Bahamas does not have an income tax. Extradition is not possible unless the ""crime"" for which the country asking for extradition is also a crime in the country harboring the criminal. Tax evasion is not a crme in the Bahamas.  Look for the US to manufacture a different crime."
Sunrise this morning.
Here's a photo of my Bahamian attorney in case anyone want to arm wrestle him to get the truth:)
Trolls claim that the letter from my attorney regarding releasing the identity if Satoshi is bogus. I've never heard such idiocy. The letter includes phone numbers and addresses of 5 of his firm's offices and he is one if the premiere lawyers in the Bahamas. Get real people!
"Our 35th ""If My Life Was a Movie"" award goes to @PeterMcCormack. Congratulations.  Thanks to @money_alotta"
"Our 34th ""If My Life Was a Movie"" award gies to  @notsofast . Congratulations.  Thanis to  @money_alotta"

".@backdoorviews, our best drone operator by far, got her drones in the air this morning. Our early warning system is nearing completion. The Freedom boat was her first test."
My delta wing sport plane in New Mexico 6 years ago. I was a sport pilot and instructor. My 23 year old son was killed in an identical plane (mine) two years earlier. I quit the sport a year after this photo was taken. 4 of my friends were killed while involved in this sport.
"Returning home to the Freedom Boat - legally named ""The Great Mystery""."
"Please stop dissing my lawyer. We are in Exuma, Bahamas. At least he has Internet access and knows what email is. Some lawyers here do not. Lighten up. The whole world is not America."
And with that I'm off to the opening ceremonies of the Exuma Sailing Regatta (the real reason @theemrsmcafee let me out of jail I suspect). This is a once a year massive party event. Will report back when I regain consciousness. Love you all.
"The US extradition request to the Bahamas  is imminent. I met with Mario Gray, my extradition lawyer, and it is now clear (read his letter below) that releasing the identity of Satoshi at this time could influence the trial and risk my extradition. I cannot risk that. I'll wait."
The NSA now has my “case”. Odd for a tax offense. The NSA knows about 3 of my 11 phones and idiotically planted the same software on 2 of them. All software has bugs. When the identical anomalies appeared on 2 of them I investigated. We are actually paying for this ineptitude.
"I'm back. My jailer (@theemrsmcafee) released me. I have been dealing with some very serious issues - the NSA, extradition, Satoshi, and many others. My susequent tweets will explain. I missed all of you. Forgive in advance the spamming I am about to do in the subsequent tweets."
"From @theemrsmcafee For @officialmcafee:  Imagine doing this job for an entire day. Scary, yes? Imagine doing this job, or a similar job, for five days straight. Imagine doing it for a month. A year. Your entire life. If your mind can grasp this, then tell me it is not slavery."
"From @theemrsmcafee:  My husband's interview with Purple Hearts Podcast. They came all the way to the Bahamas for their interview. If you want to get into the mind of @officialmcafee, this is a great place to start."
From @theemrsmcafee:
"From @theemrsmcafee;  No, I have not kidnapped @officialmcafee. Here is a pic from this morning. Tell me he does not look better already."
"From @theemrsmcafee: Im keeping @officialmcafee's phone for another couple of days. He will be back on Wednesday. His energy is improving but I want him in tip top shape. In the meantime here is some humor that he, at least, will appreciate."
"Our 30th. 31st, 32nd and 33rd ""If My Life Was a Movie"" awards. To see the full awards gallery:"
"I'm @theemrsmcafee. I've mandated a forced rest from work for my husband until at least Monday. If you don't think he needs rest, listen to his music composition todsy. I'll return him to you when I think he's ready."
I'm @theemrsmcafee - John's wife. He is unavailable to everyone except me for a few days. If you want to feel his mood -- listen to the tone of his composition today. I'll return him to you when I feel he's ready.
"Let's drop science for a moment and assume we know nothing of thermodynamics - which I find questionable in any case - and someone shows you a thermos bottle. Put hot stuff in - stays hot. Cold stuff - stays cold. First question in my mind would be: ""How the fuck does it know?"""
"Again people, don't make yourselves look foolish by contacting me and claiming to be Satoshi. If you need to contact me to reveal yourself then you are not him."
"I have received today dozens of communications from people and groups claiming to be Satoshi. Below is an example email and my responses. So people, please - i do know who Satoshi is. Don't make yourself look foolish by pretending. I will do as I did below. BTW - big clue below:"
How we becane slaves to our Government/MegaCorps.   Thanks to @CrypToroMx
"Are there such things as ""Good Fucks"" in the animal kingdom? Ever considered it? I mean: do female cows, for example, gossip like: ""That bull with the white patch -- best fuck I've ever had""."
B2G has shown a 30% price increase in the past 30 days. Still time to hop onboard.
"How do I know about Satoshi?  Yes, I drink, use drugs, chase women, run from the law - which I have done since I was 19. But it does not obviate the fact that I created a great company whose focus was stopping hackers. I had to know hacking. I am still John Fucking McAfee,"
"Wow!! Im getting flack for forcing Satoshi into the open. Please see: the ""not knowing"" is allowing people to falsely claim the title. This wreaks havoc. For example: Craig Wright's fake claim to be Satoshi is fully responsible for the BSV scam which hurt us all."
"I protected the identity of Satoshi. It's time, though, that this be put to bed. Imposters claim to be him, we are spending time and energy in search of him - It's a waste. Every day I will narrow down the identity of Satoshi until he reveals himself, or I reveal him."
"The ""Who is Satoshi?"" Mystery must end! First: It is NOT the CIA nor any agency of any world government. It IS a collection of people, but the white paper was written by one man, who currentky resides in the US. If he does not come forward these narrowings will continue."
Moinset this morning at Exuma Harbor: thanks to @backdoorviews
".@OKEx, based on a twitter poll which was obviously manipulated by bots, is continuing to support BSV - the most obvious scam yet to emerge from the world of Crypto. No one ar Okex could possibly believe otherwise, yet they are still listing BSV. Please EVERYONE boycott Okex."
"Our 29th ""If My Life Was a Movie"" award goes to @CalvinAyre. Congratulations Calvin Ayre!!  I do not know @money_alotta."
"My first Mixology 101 from Exuma Isle -- the ""Bahama Grandmama"".."
"Tanya - International spy, asassin, party animal - selling me on the idea of creating an ""Amsterdam"" here on Grand Exuma Island. @theemrsmcafee may have caught wind of it because Tanya has been missing for 7 hours."
"Our next ""if My Life Was a Movie"" award is going to CALVIN  AYRE.  We will be fair. We will not mention, for example, his Twitter photo with a 21 year old woman whom he has known for ""years"". There's simply no way to describe such unexpectedness. ""Divine absurdity"" comes closest."
"Our 28th ""If My Life Was a Movie"" award Hors to @bgarlinghouse. Congratulstions Brad.  And congratulations @money_alotta in  annihilating your Clone, leaving you as the only person left to credit this poster to."
Pig Island
"""I can't drink Boss's beer huh? Well. . . Fuck you Boss! I can find my own beer."" -- Brought to you by the Bahamian Society of German Shepherds."
"BSV claims it's Satoshi's real intent, yet the facts: Satoshi's white paper was implemented to a ""T"" in BTC. Nothing left out. Nothing added. If BSV was his true vision then either Satoshi is the worst communicator in the world, or Craig Wright, Calvin Ayre and BSV are frauds."
The TemradeSatoshi exchange is actively supporting BSV. Can someone organize a boycott of Tradesatoshi? The crypto community is being severely harmed by the exumistence if BSV. It must disappear.
"Let's get to the bottom line of Craig Wright: a man claiming to be someone but refusing to prove it, even though, if he was that someone, the proof of the claim would be trivial. Are we as stupid as Craig assumes we are? God I hope not."
"More and more headlines converging on a prediction that I cannot mathematically lose. All you ""Eat your dick"" airheads - please identify yourselves by commenting appropriately, so that at the end of 2020, the people who could add, subtract and multiply can have a good laugh."
It's my considered opinion that BSV is using Craig Wright's bogus claim to be Satoshi as a means to fraudulently increase their price. God bless @cz_binance for having the courage to delist them!
"Enough is enough! There at least a dozen crypto adherents who know the true identity of Satoshi. I can assure you, 100%, it is NOT Craig Wright. This absurd claim of Craig's is incomprehensible. Mr wright: Have you no shame? Seriously sir! Have you no shame?"

"My pet and, til now, private project. Before I am judged, consider: Someone or some group will inevitably consider this insidious control opportunity and implement it. Would you rather it be secret and people unaware of its existence, or open source? I am close to a working POC."
"My prior tweet about Notre Dame: I understand that terrible things were done there and I fully understand the ""Let it Burn"" sentiment. But can we not separate an object from the acts done by people around, on or within it? If not, the entire world of art is subject to revaluing."
"Notre Dame is on fire. ""Our Lady"" has stood, for 856 years, as one of the last tangible icons that prove that humans can, rarely and under unusual curcumstances, create profound and lasting beauty - a testament of hope for humanity."
Come on people!!! It's time to brush up your basic math skills and run some f*^#$ng numbers!!!! It is mathematically impossible for Bitcoin to be less than $1 mil by the end of 2020. Bitcoin is not an effing stock!!! You can't apply stock paradigms or formulas and expect answers!
Bad hair day.
Racing to get back to Freedom Boat before dark. Thanks for the video Joanna.
The idiocy of media: The stars of Miami Vice are shown (1:50) in a 50' speed boat speeding at 50 miles per hour in 4 foot seas. Neither have their hands on the wheel or the throttle. They're just holding on. So someone is crouching between their knees.
Well... he's right about one thing - Bitcoin will certainly EXCEED $one mil within 7 years.
"The Freedom Boat: 6 bedrooms. 6 baths. 4,000 horse power. 4 dogs. 9 people (currently). One RIB 17' tender (carried on bow)Two years supply of food. Bulletproof. Heavilly armed. The headquarters of McAfee2020."

"CoinRivet sued by Calvin Ayre. I'm suing Calvin for $800 mil. Calvin stated that I committed murder. Completely unsubstantiable. Cuba is a Civil Law country - making lawsuits diffucult. However, I traced his assets to other countries. I will bankrupt him."

A word from Paradise
"Our 23rd ""If My Life Was a Movie"" award goes to @joerogan. Congratulations Joe.  @money_alotta's Clone was wholey responsible for this poster."
"Last June, @theemrsmcafee, @TheReal_Wolf_  and myself planned how to free Julian: send a journalist of his physique wearing a fake black beard and concealing a white wig.  Epic clothes and hair swap!  I found the journalst.  Julian's people didn't respond. I could have done this."
Julian Assange arrested in London. Ecuador removed his Sanctuary status. Will you stand by and let our government use him as an example 9f their illegal reach? At least make some fucking noise. How much noise can you make? Let me see!

"Have not verified their claims, but am working on it. When I have hard data zmI will report."
"I've mentioned Bitcoiin a few times. (not Bitcoin). I'm watching them closely to see if they actually produce. Their mobile wallets came out right on time. Havent tried the IOS version, surely no one uses IOS anymore."
"Our housekeeper Melissa (boatkeeper is better) is pregnant and due in two months. An Iranian physicist who is on the run and living here, claims to have invented a true Teleportation device. He wants to demonstrate by teleporting Melissa's baby out of her when due. Watcha think?"
"I got serious flack for using the word ""niggah"" (not ""nigger"") in my prior post, which referenced a video in which ""niggah"" was used 13 times. No one complained about the video. The only complaint was that I used the word once when referencing it. Wake up!"
You gotta git yo own bag Niggah! ( Being married to a black woman and having the largest dick on record gives me the right to say that word.)
"Now here's an unexpected data point: with 7,000+ respondents, 77% of my 900,000 followers believe the US government should be scrapped completely. When I have spoken of this in the past, i did not mean our Constitution, but the myriad of government angencies that oppress us."
"Some of you wonder what life around me is really like. Here is an 8 minute voice recording of six of us in near total darkness, telling stories last night. I am the only one who knows it is being recorded."

"Our 20th ""If My Life Was a Movie"" award goes to  @parabolictrav. Congratulations Trav.  @money_alotta has an alibi proving he was elsewhere during the creation of this poster."
Finally got my keyboard. My fingers have been itching.
"What can I say? I mean, my blender once crept into the salon to watch a Fox News segment but I just ordered it back into the kitchen. No gun play was necessary. But ... who knows?"
"Naysayers saying the rise in BTC is due to a single buyer. Does it matter? It has continued to rise after the big buys. Can you not see that the buyers, like me, recognized the market turn that they were waiting for."
"The US Constitution - that most beautiful of all documents - allows for a ""Constitutional Convention"" (Article 5) in which every aspect of the Constitution may be examined and changed, replaced or even dropped, as deemed necessary by the people. This is one avenue of correction."
The US Government needs to be scrapped in its entirety and we need to start over:

"Is Nyana really my daughter?  ""Yes"". ""No"" would be part false. I do know this: In the ways that matter, there is no question. I have scrutinized her, looking for signs of myself:  she mirrors my thought crimes to a T, and could be my young self in her talent for deceiving adults."
"My ""Evil"" clone masks arrived. You may now join my ""Evil Clone Army"" or my ""Good Clone Army"" with equal ease:"
"Happy birthday to my just turned 17 year old daughter Nyana, @YounginMula. I love you Baby Girl, and remember my admonition: Stay away from boys until you're 30:)"
"From an associate of @money_alotta (the creator of ""If My Life Was a Movie"":"
The Coinsbank Blockchain Cruise video is finally available!!!! I've  been waiting for this. Want to see how crypto winners live and celebrate? (A winner is anyone who hodls). Want to glimpse a world free from centralized powers? Then watch this!
"My Talent Team selected me for their tenth ""If My Life Was a Movie"" award. Thanks, especially to @money_alotta. You are all extraordinary, unique creatures. Not just ny Talent Team, but every infividual following me."
My interview with Coinrivet:
My Campaign Manager's personality changes when he puts on my new clone mask. He frightens children and makes Pit Bulls whimper when he glances at them. Take a look. Should I send the masks back?
A shout out for my man Steve. Go Beatzcoin!
Is this list still accurate from 6 months ago? Anyone who should be removed (other than me)? Added? Thank you. There is a reason for my asking.
Apollo: ignore the trolls. Look at Bitmain - the most successful company in crypto in spite of being the most hated. Apollo generates animosity because it's a threat to other coins. But people: You have choices. Don't like Apollo? Don't use it!
"MTT's 9th ""If My Life Was a Movie"" award goes to the Winklevoss Twins. - @winklevoss and @tylerwinklevoss. I don't know them well (had dinner and drinks with them in Malta once), but I feel their influence on every avenue and back alley in crypto. Thanks again to @money_alotta."
"MTT's 8th ""If My Life Was a Movie"" award goes to @JihanWu, a good friend and the most humble man I have had the pleasure to meet. As usual, thanks to @money_alotta for the brilliant work. Congratulations."
"The Clone Armyy's Warrior masks arrived today. Totally distinct from the civilian masks. They are nylon, pull over the head style and look very real. Freaky, but real."
"MTT's 7th ""If My Life Was a Movie"" award goes to @lopp. Thanks as usual to @money_alotta for the razor sharp summations of human nature."
"Night and day on Great Exuma. Exquisitely beautiful. However, the US war on drugs snd other crimes has nearly destroyed this place. America spreads its laws like the plague, demanding that uncomplicated cultures act and  behave as if they lived in D.C."
"MTT's 6th ""If My Life Was a Movie"" award goes to Roger Ver (Thanks to MTT rising star @money_alotta). I do not care what you think of Roger Ver. He is my friend, and you cannit deny he loves crypto as much as anyone."
"The John McAfee in this letter is not me, but he looks like me (one of many). We have a contract in which he can help me if he wants but no obligation (I own nothing). The poor bastard does, however suffer from my misdeeds. This time he is banned from any Chase Bank Property."
One of the biggest issues with current cryptos is blockchain bloat. Apollo is one of the only coins to solve this problem. Their release of Sharding will make it one of the most advanced coins on the market and one of the only options viable long term.
"Here is the Pomp link forAndroid:    Pomp is a smart dude, and aside from his brother's addiction to Smack, is clean. However, he took the blue pill. He shows no shame in pulling out a device with 20 year old technology for which he paid double - iPhone."
Oops .. Forgot to tag @money_alotta for the past two MTT movie awards - @VitalikButerin  and @ruchardheartwun. Sorry
"MTT's fifth ""If My Life Was a Movie"" award goes to @VitalikButerin. Congratulations Vitalik."
"MTT's fourth ""If My Life Was a Movie"" award goes to @RichardHeartWin. Congratulations!"
"The third MTT ""If My Life Was a Movie"" award goes to @justinsuntron. @money_alotta outdid himself this time I think."
".@money_alotta is MTT driven. Some of you want posters, but the  posters are an honor formally bestowed on outstanding talent in CT by MTT. If you want a poster we can maybe create a new format that does not dilute the awarded Posters. DM me or email me at loggia@loggiaonfire.com"
A fool is a person who does not great every moment of life armed with a healthy dose of skepticism.
.@money_alotta - one of the full time staff at McAfee Talent Team (where people get to do what they want) wants to recognize the contributors to CT by making a “If my life was a Movie” gallery and  create movie posters for each individual. First two: @joelcomm and @APompliano
"The funniest quandry in a year for me. And Spy reveals the ""real"" Spy. Do not miss this one."
"I would not disrespect the McAfee Talent Team by asking them to do something as mundane as a movie poster. At the same time,  @APompliano turned out to be a very special person and I felt he deserved the effort. @money_alotta,  a rising star in ny Talent Team, gladly took it on:"
".@MustacheTommy, one of my original thinkers in the McAfee Talent Team, put this together after @APompliano announced that he had scored an interview with me and posted the pic."
"Some projects first do a Website (not how I would order my development). Others create the product and then the site (clearly serious developers). The Beatzcoin team waited til the last fucking second - as if one if them said: ""are we missing anything?"""
"A great article explaining the confusion and anger surrounding the release of BitFi - the safest hardware wallet, and one that I am heavily promoting. Got off on the wrap. start because we labeled it ""Unhackable""."
Nearly 3 months in exile. Time flies. We live on a boat designed by Buddy Davis - Anerica's greatest builder of sport fishers. This one for a drug lord who wanted it bulletproof. Cost 9 mil 20 years ago. Now fully restored to original glory.. The grace of my friends is legendary.
"The Skycoin War is personal. Let me say: Synth is a good man but narrow. While we should have been working he spent, literally. 100's of hours tutoring me on chelation and nutrients to balance my chemistry so I wouldn't need to fuck whales. I went along with it for convenience."
".@forexer7777777 asked the source of what power I may or may not have:  It's From my understanding of the world and of our place in it, and from my understanding of the human animal itself, of which I am an example - available full time for my study since I was 14 and curious."
"I love  the 100k follower marks. Each time, When i am close to a 100k mark, like now, war happens. I gain 1,000 followers in a day and suddenly 1,000 followers unfollow me. You gotta watch it. Twitter? Stupid hacker? No matter. They don't see that my power is not in numbers."
Thus is my feeling in the matter:
God ... .. I love business spats. Ok then .. here's the real story: Synth (founder and CEO of Skycoin) feels strongly that human/whale intimate relations are non consensual for the whale and therefore represents sexual abuse. I disagree strongly
"Hollywood?  Michael Keaton replaced Johnny Depp to play me in King of the Jungle. I know him not. Met him twice - parties. Said less than 5 words: ""Where's the fucking booze"" anyway I DM'd him explained  I was black with a skin ailment and pissed they chose him. Never responded."
"Randy Quaid has also followed me forever. However his ""Crazy"" is SOOO deep, convoluted and greased rabbit hole scary, that I was reluctant at first to even follow him back. How many ways can you take a follow? With Randy it's infinate.  Might be looking over my shoulder forever."
"Val Kilmer has been following me for years with me thinking he was not. I finally shot a mostly snotty DM over, saying that in his movies he was an actor in a play trying to act the reality was the actuality of my real life, boy"" That's why I pity you old man"" he replied."
"People ask why I do the difficult and dangerous things I do, instead of dancing off into the sunset with @theemrsmcafee by my side. It's simple. I am, and always have been, unfortunately, driven by forces beyond my control."
Teaching Axel how to eat from a fork
"This photo was taken by Ricky, using a potato or something similar for a camera. It did catch me floating in the bay while smoking however. @theemrsmcafee has forbidden me to smoke while swimming. Unhealthy she says. Somehow I doubt it and just indulge."
". @Loggiaonfire, my Campaign Manager, live on the @LarryandJoeShow"
Those interested in the actual facts of the case will find a great video here:
"And looking closely at the problem in Humans that causes this blight, we see it is caused by their governments - entitles designed to construct realitues for the 99% of humans who live in fear and are manipulated by that."
"For the past 50,000 years, two forms of life have co-existed on this planet. One, a cooperative competition, churning in absolute beauty. The other, an isolated species, tragically believing itself to be in charge -- the only blot on this absolute beauty."
"But some fought. Grew strong,  hunted cooperatively - magnifying the indiual teeth, and learning where to survive away from man: Snow leopards in the highest mountains. Panthers and jaguars that melt into the jungle. Wolves, whose historic branch brought two species back together"
"The REAL 1st Wirld War: when Teeth were the real signs of power. Then man, with puny teeth, emerged and, using technology, created artificial teeth from flint and bone - sharper, larger, attatched to longg sticks - teeth like none had been seen before. Man conquered the Animals."
I am no longer working with or promoting Skycoin. DM me if you want to know the reasons.
"Rob Loggia @Loggiaonfire, my Campaign Manager on the @LarryandJoeShow 8:00 PM Eastern tonight will have two surprise guests. Anyone wanting to fuck with him think twice. He is my BFF. I know him well. The most dangerous man of the past 25 years. Suggestion: ask polite questions."
"You say the world's powers will stop Bitcoin? Impossible. New technologies always wind. All the laughter in the world, plus a huge war with the most powerful industry in the world at the time - the Railroads - did not stop the Model-T from ushering in the age of automobiles."
People complaining about Bitcoin price manipulation by powerful players. Forget it. There's not enough power on Earth that can stop Bitcoin in the long run. Relax and be patient.
Still above 4K
"About my campaign manager - Rob Loggia's handle - @Loggiaonfire. He has never told me,  but one of my security who saw him swimming at night, swears that 80% of his body is covered with burn scars. I've never seen it personally. He's on @LarryandJoeShow tonight 8:00 PM Eastern."
"Rob Loggia - @Loggiaonfire, McAfee2020 campaign manager, will be on the @LarryandJoeShow show tonight at 8:00 PM Eastern. You think I'm outta the box, wait til you get a load of him."
Finally: Bitcoin broke through the the 4K barrier
"People ask what we eat on this island. Simple: Fish, birds, coconut, crabs, iguana, banana, papaya, avocado, pig and peanuts-- plentiful. Vegetables and berries are like the millions of lost Bitcoins: people would sell their mothers into slavery for a head of lettuce.."

"Marley, as usual, taking up twice the space or squeezing himself into a well trafficked through way. He does this to annoy."
"When I post anything that appears I'm supporting Liberals OR conservatives, I lose a few thousand followers. Same with my support of firearms. I avoid political posts now except for the gun issue. People who do not own guns terrify me. Who will protect them and those they love?"
Christchurch shootings: New Zealand gun laws became severely rstrictive after the 1990 Aramoana massacre. It is four times as difficult (as measured by per capita licensing) to own a gun in New Zealand than in the US. One more example that tougher gun laws cannot stop criminals.
Thanks to @money_alotta for my new Twitter header.
Dont forget boys and girls - the @LarryandJoeShow will be in Times Square again tomorrow at 3:00. Their show will involve field testing the McAfee2020 clone system and allowing me to give a short speech. Tomorrow will be the first live activation of the human clones. Im excited.

Slaves believe what their masters say. Propaganda falsely informs a slave citizenry.   You believe anything authoritative.  I wanted to demonstrate and told you I fucked Whales. Impossible. Yet in polls up to 80% believed me.   Question every belief you hold. And my apologies.

Getting prepped on the boat for going live in a few minutes
The @LarryandJoeShow is now at Times Square ready to go live with one of the World's most out-of-the-box political experiments.
"For the @LarryandJoeShow in Times Square, where both will wear my mask and be my Clones. To Joe  It occurred to me: only one of you should wear the mask at first. Then at the end, both of you wear it, while I talk about the multiplied power of what we are doing. Trust me on this."
"The oddest thing is the type of emails, DMs, texts, etc. that I receive every day asking for advice. From me??? Yes. On careers, partners, lifestyles, where to live, whether to marry. .... sometimes even -- ""I dont even know who I am ... how can I know what I want?"" Perfect.Then:"
"Chelsea Manning's statement about about not complying with the Grand Jury's demands. I am in the exact same situation and could not put it into better words, so here it is:"
Don't forget folks - @LarryandJoeShow will be in Times Square today between 2:00 and 3:00 representing me as two of my clones. Come hear me speak or ask me questions in person. Come see a groundbreaking concept that will forever change our political landscape.
"Forget nuclear war. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Gov. funded study to prevent cows from farting will, in my humble opinion, be the root cause of widespread decimation of the human population when 1.5 billion cows almost simultaneously explode."
"I also bought three Male hats ($14.00 each) that show great ""Hat Magic"" promise."
I actually weaseled my way behind the counter because this customer service rep could not look at me. I could have safely emptied the cash register. This hat has some serious magic in it.
"I think that a man is partially measured by the size of his balls. I was challenged to wear this obvious woman's hat and to wallk through Nassau's largest mall, and Bahama is the most homophobic country on earth. I will turn this hat into the most masculine thing in the world."
Not my fucking day. After sending three grand to an emergency notary I ate candy and broke a crown off at the root. The pain is bad but I could not do a root extraction because I'm on LIVE at the first clone event in Times Square tomorrow. At least I can get OTC morphine here.
"I hope everyone realizes the political game changing nature of the @LarryandJoeShow hosts being my Clones in Times Square tomorrow. The proof of concept will allow politicians to literally be everywhere at once. Every major news outlet except for AbC, Fox and CNBC will be there."
"Our Government at work, or, rather, not at work: my legal situation requires tons if documents some of which must be notarized by a US notary. One service that our Embassies provide is notorization. I flew to Nassai today to the Embassy closed at 11:00 AM. Had to pay over $3,000"
"Vote every politician out. It doesn""t matter who gets in  - derelicts, motorcycle gangs, the insane, librarians. It will take 50 years for a burdensome power structure to gel. In the meantime nothing will get done. Which is better than the sick shit that is getting done now"
"Want a less severe Government? One that you don't carry on your back? One that doesn't enslave you, doesn't tell you what you can put in your body and your mind? One that let's you live free? Then vote the entire Government out. Every. Last. One."

There's confusion:  There are different discomforts. One is caused by doing something from a sense of obligation to another. It's debilitating I was talking to these people. The other stems from enduring the initiation of something new you want to explore -- necessary for growth.
Never do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. No real or imagined obligation is worth discomfort. You are not here to please life. Life is here to please you.

"The Blockchain cruise is coming up. Most fun there is in CryptoSpace. All of us ""Peculiar"" people will be there. ""Freaky"" might be more apt for me, but, standing next to my good friend Brock Pierce (he's on the cruise) and others, i am supernormal."
People laugh when I say Bitcoin will reach a million. I think the nature of my bet has caused people to overlook the dozens of our industry leaders who wholeheartedly agree. Not hitting a million is the laughable stance for anyone who digs into it deeply.

A nearly unbelievable story in the Washington Post today in which I unfortunately play a part.
.#saynotowar  This hashtag is number one trending on Twitter and is being widely used on both sides of the India/Pakistan border. The Indian Prime Minister surprisingly gives a conciliatory speech as War looms. Are we seeing the first link betwern SM and real world conflict?
"Good to see Hardware Wallets being sold on Amazon. Crypto is on its way to becimung mainstream. If you don't have a Hard Wallet, btw, you are taking undue risk. Get a Bitfi, Trezor or Ledger. For me, BitFi is most secure, but any are better than none."
More and more people are saying Bitcoin has bottomed:
IBM's VP of Blockchain and Digital Currencies predicts Bitcoin at $1 mil:
"Questioning whether I'm ""good"" for The Twitter community. As if Twitter was a group of individuals sharing a common set of values. Values are unique to  every person. Is it good to quit your job because it's enslaving you or bad because you won't be able to support your family?"
".@dangr76  is the newest addition to my Worldwide Outreach Campaign. He will be managing my clone speaking appeareances, information dissemination and campaign networking for the country of Ireland. Danny is sharp, capable and,  as a fellow Irishman, man of my heart."
"I never once claimed to have personally written the first Virus Scanning progam. I designed it and hired a coder. It's what nearly every entrepreneur does. I was unaware that anyone believed that, at the age of 46, i still did my own coding."
"Many of my new followers missed my confession about the bath salts. Since it will be a huge campaign issue that will be used against me by my detractors, here is my confession yet again:"
"When a Bull Run starts, it doesn't just go in a straight line to the moon. It sputters and spurts - like starting an engine that hasn't been run for a while. We're seeing this now. Ignore daily fluctuations. Watch the week by week trends. It's here."
"Don't let ""what might be"" influence ""what is. Or ""Live. Here. And now."""
"Ramblimgs. How to promote a derelict, over the hill, drug addled old man, and much ado about Smollet."
"My Clone army is readying. My nightmare: A clone is supposed to do a keynote but instead is at a bank with a gun. I am ready to speak through the clone, who is waving the gun and placing empty bags at each teller station. I begin: ""The Bear Market Is over. Fill the fucking bags."""
"I am still getting used to Bahamian weed (and other medicinal plants.) Last night is still happening for me, that's how unused to this weed that I am. Anyway, ""wasted"" would be a starving squirrel compared the nameless state that I reached. And I tweeted. Beyond overmuch. Example"
"Patryk leaves tomorrow. I'll miss the drunk German. He runs Getnode. I dabble in unique ideas and found it last year. It returned about 20% per month in a bear market. Not bad. Patryk is smart. Not investment advice, but click the link and watch the video."
"For the crypto crowd; The rumors that a Twitter user with Blockchain expertise has discovered a way to fork their followers are true. Everyone ignored me when I raised the alarm about the threat of followforking. Now it's here, don't ask me for help or advice. You're on your own."
"I get lots if ""followback"" requests. Followbacks happen in the followized zone of Twitterspace. I'm  The followless zone - no underfollows or overfollows. For the best followment, those interested in followship should avoid this followless zone and stay in the followized segment."
Some of you may have noticed that Twitter unfollowed me on your behalf without your knowledge. It's been happening for more than a year with hundreds of thousands of unfollows. It's a Twitter employee that has no life and therefore has to hate on others. We're close to fixing it.
"Tommy has been one of my biggest supporters. He sent me this video with the following note:  ""I dedicate this video to you Sir McAfee.  Thank you for your support throughout this bear market.  I wish you and Janice well.""  God bless you Tommy."
"How will Bitcoin flourish? By it's expanding use as an actual currency. 21 million coins, to support a notable percentage of World commerce. Even at 1%,  a fifth grader could run the numbers get more than a million by the end of 2020."
About my prediction that Bitcoin will reach $1 mil before Dec 30th 2020;
"IBM's Blockchain Vice President and myself agree that a $1 million Bitcoin is around the corner.  Others are seeing it too. It, in all sincerety,  astonishes me that everyone doesnt see it."
"Bitcoin undervalued today by $34,000;"
Feeding the sharks while discussing the relativity of time:
"Britain's greatest contribution to the world of Mind Fuck: Drive on the left.  In a world  of right handed people, and the word ""sinister"" meaning, literally, left handed, the British chose to drive on the left. No offense intended to you sinister folks out there. I'm with you."
"The restroom at the doctor's office. In the poorest of facilities, and in a town of only 900 people,  all is neat and clean. I'm here because my male member - the largest part of me at birth - has been slowly and unaccountably enlarging. Finally @theemrsmcafee lodged a complaint."
"Jesus! The media yet again! ""By Dec. 31. 2020"", is not an exact date. Let's all be clear again: I predicted Bitcoin would reach $1,000,000 before the end of 2020. That is not saying it will hit that price on that date."
"There is one dentist on Exuma. This is the only sign he has. All the signs are generic. There's a ""Doctor"" sign. And a ""Lawyer"" sign, although that office has not opened for the past month. And a ""thought"" sign. Ill take a photo later. Oh . . . . And a ""Will Do It"" sign."
My rant on the Larry and Joe show:
Ricky dances with a gangster. I profess my true feelings for my wife @theemrsmcafee . And other stuff.
"People are waking up to the fact that Bitcoin will be $1,000 000. But when? ""Someday"". ""Maybe 5 years"". ""WIthin a decade"".  I'm the only one giving you a hard date: Dec 31st, 2020."
"Patryk and I tonight on the Larry and Joe show. NSFW. In fact, not safe for anything. Plug your ears, blindfold yourself, have your spouse tie you to a chair and then have her play this for you.... No ....won't work. Just don't watch this fucking thing."
After 9 million views there are still folks who have not sern this. My first and last acting job. For old times sake: How To Uninstall McAfee Antivirus   via @YouTube
"I define a boat as ""A hole in the water into which you throw money"". Well, here's Ricky, doing his full time job - keeping this boat afloat for less rhan $1,600 a day, (Average maintenance cost for the Freedom Boat before Ricky).  Of course, the boat is all duct tape now."
The notorious Patryk Labus and I will be on the @LarryandJoeShow tonight at 8:00 Eastern. Patryk is my campaign manager for Germany - part if my 2020 Potus Campaign Foreign Outreach Program. Here is my last interview with them:
List of top influencers in the Crypto space.   Influencers.  Think about it. Do you really want to be influenced by a total stranger? Or anyone for that matter. An influencer is someone who sways you to their way. Influence is a powerful drug for sheep.
Another good article about   - my favorite hardware wallet.
Looks like the drugs have finally arrived.
"Meet Shelton, our newest resident on the Freedom Boat."
"Again, from ""Reason Magazine"":   Me: ""The biggest problem is that we don't have a clue what our Government is really doing. Our Government keeps secrets while spying on us. How the fuck do I solve a problem I don't know the truth about? We have to solvethatproblem first."""
"From ""Reason Magazine"" when asked how I would solve the Middle East problem: Me: "":Do you speak Farsi? Neither do I. Do you understand the nuts and bolts and nuances of their religion, culture, history, political alliances? No. Yet you want me to solvetheirproblems? Fuck that."
"There is no worse companion on earth than a drunk German, and Patryk is drunk. Forget his past. His Present is abominable. We are at the bar and the entire scene is going South.  Perhaps Jamaica will take us if worse comes to worse."
"Meet the man who you, my followers, so soundly dissed me for working with:"
"Soundly dissed for choosing an ex gamgster to run my German outreach..I like people wlith depth, whether that depth is had by meditation, suffering, bliss, advwnture, sacrifice or by simply walking the dark side.  People in a box do not interest me. The real world fits in no box."
"Patrik Labus, the McAfee2020 Campaign Director for Germany, divulged today that until 5 years ago he was President of the Black Jackets - the second largest criminal biker gang in Germany. I knew there was a reason I liked him. Here he is in bad times:"
"Please God!! Will someone write an app that collects DMs and nessagea from Signal, WeChat, Faceboik, Twitter, Skype, Telegram, Instagram, and the rest of rhe growing jungle of texting apps that are eroding my days. Big priblem is replying later and finding where the fuck it was."
"Radio interview with ""The Federalist"". They chose not to edit out my language and up frontĺ warned all parents not to let their children listen. I listened. I found nothing offensive."
"Patrik Labus is not on social media, but in Europe he is well know for his band of world famous rogue tattoo artists. He is now our official campaign tattooist"
We found a bar that had not heard of us. They unwisely let us in.
Looking for a new bar. We've been thrown out of the last bar that would tolerate us in Georgetown
"It doesn't matter who is president. The moment a president takes office they become a puppet with 1,000 strings. What matters is telling the truth on a stage that people will watch. That is what I am doing."
"Does our government fear us? Does it act so? Does it try to control us for it's own self preservation? If so the signs would be secrets, lies, disininfirmation, spying on us, moral decay, blaming others, telling us what we want to hear instead if truth. Is that happening?"
"History as a guide? We know only the poorest scraps of history. It is a self serving fiction, written by conquerors, with no input from the vanquished, and with no due process for requiring truth or fact. Our government is right now creating history in this same truthless manner"
"We define ourselves through our values, which determine our judgements. But how can we judge when what we know of this World is a web of lies fed to us by an insane government. We have no basis of fact from which to judge or fix anything. Left wing, right wing - equally lost."
"I see no difference between Democrats and Republicans, or extreme right and extreme left.. Both are narrow, dismissive, pedantic, bigoted, power hungry and self serving. They should join forces. They are one body wearing two different brands of stupid.."
"The day is done, and Great Exuma - the most beautiful island on the planet, both physically and as felt in the hearts of its people - is tilting on the edge of evening, when, every day, a quiet celebration coalesces from the air, and building, burns away the chaff of the day."
"We need a few full time adventurers/volunteers for our Bahamian Campaign in Exile Headquarters. Must be fully self supporting, courageous, self motivated, committed to personal freedom and ready  for an adventure of a lifetime. Email 2020exile@gmail.com."
EVERY LAST ONE!!!!!
"Each day people in foreign countries offer to help with my Campaign. On the surface it seems ridiculous. But really, why not? So Im doing a test in Germany. @LabusPatryk flew 30 hours from Bangkok to me here in the Bahamas to plan a strategy. Boy do we have one."
What will the 2020 Presidential race do for Crypto?
"Back at the third floor of the ""compound"". We are just mellowing out after a day of speeding between islands in my first test of our tender (Moored alongside)"
"A boring video. But Rick took it. He's proud of it. He asked me to tweet it. I just did. He is outside of social media however, so I can dis him in this (for him) alternate universe, while I truly love him in that universe which, for me at this moment time, is alternate."
"My interview with Jenna Friedman. You may think it would be the clash of the Century, but it was, oddly, not that bad at all. Instead of radical feminist bs radical chauvinist pig, it ended up a mere inelegant but very real dance between two strangers."
We the people are America. These pricks that we so thoughtlessly put into power in our Government are no more than servants of the people. Do they act like servants? If not why the fuck are we choosing them?
Rick caught me with my harmonica attempting to regain favor with IT guy. He was way out of my league.
Holy FUCK!!! My Bahamian IT guy -- whom I judged to be the dweebyest person on earth -- shows up in the band I hired for Choppy's bar for the weekend. People -- never judge. The IT guy is the sax player.
"Denado, one of my Bahamian security with @theemrsmcafee and myself at Choppy's Bar in Georgetown. We all used Valentine's day as a reason to waste it. And wasted we are."
"My wife @theemrsmcafee enduring the burden of exile. Her smile is ever present, even in these dire and bleak conditions. She provides strength as we are all virtually forced by the locals to dance, sing and ingest startling substances in a strange unending celebration. We endure."
I am a drug combination expert. You want to see what it's like as the opposite sex for 3 hours? What being kissed by God feels like. You want the infinite experience if freedom? Knowledge of yourself? Eroticism that incinerates you? A simple good time? Forgetfulness? I'm your man
"The talking dog, first act of the clones and other stuff."
".@ToddSeavey, author of ""Libertarianism for Beginners"" and publisher of ""Splice Today"", and a Libertarian Party bigwig, implied that I am an unsuitable Potus candidate. Yet he admitted that in all likelihood I will be the Party standard bearer in 2020. Unsuitable is the new cool."
Connor wrote a great article about the campaign btw:
Another good article about Bitfi. Still my favorite hardware wallet.
"This man managed to get 40,000 followers on Instagram by pretending to be me.  Anyway he is talking money from his followers using my name. If anyine here is on Instragram beware"
My entire world view is encompassed in this one interview last week:
"We are born into this world with an instruction manual. It is our parents, teachers, authorities and the control mechanisms instituted by our Government that make us behave in ways that ensures the government's self preservation. We are brainwashed sheep. Wake up! Clean house!"
"Very odd. Before I went into exile the identical poll showed that 12% would vote for me (even though I dont want votes). After going into exile it jumped to 55%, with 31,000 votes. I do the polls just to see how many are hearing my message. It seems that some are listening. Good."
"Secrets and lies. The universal truth: there are no secrets that are known by more than one person. And the burden of maintaining a lie is the most expensive, time consuming and energy draining of all of human creations. We can no longer allow our government this indulgence."
"Secrecy is the poison that corrupts our government. Secrecy and its companion, disinformation. ""We need secrets from our enemies"" they plead. Well . . let me be perfectly clear: there are NO secrets in this digital world. I would know. If you doubt, Google ""cybersecurity legend""."
How to create a sane society of adults: 1. Do no harm. 2 Do not take what is not yours 3. Tell the truth 4. Keep your word Nothing else is needed. No amount of laws or legislation can better these four principles. And we need a government that operates on these principles.
Adult rights 1. The right to work hard 2. The right to struggle for your family 3. The right to take the blame for your children's faults 4. The right to owe the bank 5. The right to maintain your property  6. The right to marry the wrong person. 7. The right to do as you please
"Got huge disapproval for adding 18 year old Scotch to a mixed drink last night. Well . . . . I'm an adult. In my world, adults may do as they please. Why on earth would you want to become one otherwise?"
Who would you vote for if the election were held today?
Shortened version of my Russian Television interview:
"My Bahamian attorney - Mario Alfred Gray. He specializes in international law and will defend my extradition from the Bahamas if it comes to that. He is sharp, aggressive and experienced in extraditions."
Go to 14:17 to hear my segment
My interview with Russian Television. I will likely get slammed now as a Russian agent:)
Fourth Annual Blockchain Cruise coming up. My favorite conferences.
"The Clone Army ""Road Warriors"" application page. Those interested in volunteering should start here:"
My name at the bottom. Couldn't help but support them after my talk with the kids. Most if the World has nothing. The might of America has taken everything. We are not affluent because we work hard. It's because we take hard.
Thoughts of you on this fine evening.
The start of the party for the evening. Me cutting loose. Unsuspecting fans who came to say hello. It. Will.  Be.  A.  Righteous.   Night.
A tour of Georgetown with one of my Bahamian Security - Big Man.
Mixology 101 on the run: the Irish Banger
"Gave a keynote to the local school - average age 11 years. I told them the most important question they could ever ask themselves was: ""Do you want to work for someone else, or do you want to work for yourself?"" Your life will be entirely different depending on the answer."
"Could I out-Trump Trump?? Coined Times thinks so. I hope not. If a dark miracle does happen and I wrongy and horrifically get elected, I'm staying home and ignoring it."
"Of all the absurdities that people buy into, the concept of ""Healthy Hair"" is the most extreme. There is no blood flow to your curly locks; no oxygen transmission; no cell activity. Your hair is dead. Unless you're buying hair products from a Necromancer, you are wasting time."
"The title is extremely accurate. My member has frequently been referred to as a monster. I am indeed a Devil to my enemies. And jungle? Not only have I lived in them, the inner workings of my mind - if not a jungle, then what the hell is it?"
"Love this description of the new movie about me in ""Dark Horizons"". They titled the article ""Monster, Devil, Jungle""."
This is clearly @theemrsmcafee's dog
"Just woke up. Sharing my first view of my world today. Today I speak to the young children of the local school. A motivational talk. If I'm not arrested as a result, I'll post the video of my grade school keynote."
"Alright!! My followers have proven too much for me. Bullfights, group orgies, Royal Weddings, Bar Mitzvahs ... my brain hurts. You have rightly broken my rigid demarcations. How about ""Anything and everything on a case by case basis"". Motherfuckers."
"Please people.  . . . Clones are not available for weddings, birthday parties, private gatherings, fraternity events, etc. Conferences, debates, large public gatherings, etc. only please."
"How the Clone Army works: each clone receives a mask (pictured).  You acquire a speaker that plugs into your smart phone (pictured). You will run Skype or Zoom so that I can speak through the speaker and see the audience, or the person I am shsking hands with. Etc. through you."
Love how chat room gramnar is seeping into Third World bysinesses. Here is a sign on Scotiabank's frint doir in Georgetown.
"""King of the Jungle"" starring Michael Keaton as me, is being acquired by STX."
I will waive my usual speaking fee when speaking at conferences through my clones. There will also be no requirement to cover the expenses of my security team which always accompanies me. The only expense will be travel and lodging for the clone.
"The McAfee2020 Clone Army is up and running and available for keynotes, public speaking etc. If you are organizing an event and would like to hear Mr. McAfee live through one of his clones please contact @Loggiaonfire or send an email to: clonearmy2020@gmail.com"
"I have not chosen a running mate yet, although I am inundated by people vying for the job. This dude showed up unannounced. Came down the Chimney I believe. Said he is loved by Americans and deserves the job. Never heard if him."
"Our first live demo of our surrogate system. I am in Georgetown talking through the wife of @Loggiaonfire, my campaign manager.  This is not an animation. Wait till the end when she removes her mask."
"Tourusts I sent to the back deck for ordering a drink I refuse to serve. If you've ordered it before or even heard of it, then you damn well better not ask me to make it. You can get ordinary shit anywhere. I didn't survive 73 years to get this job to make a fucking margarita."
"I've taken over as bartender at the Exuma Yacht Club. Even the full time bartenders agree it's an improvement. I will continue as ""Master Maker"" until my clones are ready to roll, at which time I will pass my knowledge, in full, to Shelton - my most loyal apprentice."
"Rick and I tending the Exuma bar after we taught the bartrnder how to make a Rickarita - the strongest of all my mixology 101 concoctions. It is going on the bar's menu as of tonight. Bartender had one, then went to lay down. Rick qnd trending bar til he recivers."
"From the anarchist magazine ""SpliceToday""    Now that I have been embraced by anarchists, I must abandon my conservative ways and adopt a more free spirited lifestyle. @theemrsmcafee Suggests I begin by doing my mixology videos in the nude. What say ye?"
"Many Exile HQ volunteers ask about safety. Last murder was 11 years ago. Violent crime is rare. The Bahamians here are peaceful. It's safe. And rustically beautiful. Again -' apply to 2020exile@gmail.com. The volunteer FAQ:   For a rate adventure, come."
"Glenn Beck: ""Evil is sweeping the Nation, with guests John McAfee and Bill 0'Reilly"". Since I am hardly ""sweeping the nation"", I suspect that my part in this evil is small -- a bit part or walk on at most. Possibly even a non-speaking part. Do not panic."
I tried John McAfee's signature 2020 cocktail and I will never be the same   via @SFGate
"The McAfee 2020 Road Warrior mask, Robert King, the Blues in the Bahamas and a random stranger meet at an unlikely place and time, giving rise to Blues-like emanations from my lips."
"This is my campaign manager - @Loggiaonfire. He is wearing one of our Road Warrior masks. Since I cannot show up at debates, keynote speeches, public addresses, Las Vegas strip clubs, etc., without getting arrested, my road warriors will represent me. High tech. More to come."
"Bahamian sunset, dogs, boats, an old man at the sea."
"My ""extraordinary"" plan to run for president. ""Extraordinary"". Analyse it:  nothing more than ""ordinary"" only more so. Way ordinary; extremely ordinary; extra ordinary. A media person had to have invented it and made us think that he used it right. Wrong!"
"The prior tweet should settle one question that the mainstream media has been pondering:  I didn't make this shit up. I do like to play jokes on the media, naive bastards that they are, but never to this extreme. The IRS did in fact convene a Grand Jury to indict Janice and I."
"The IRS has released no information on the Grand Jury's consensus. By now, there will have been one. What game is the prosecutor playing??? One might think that my intel was faulty ( not once in 37 years). Fortunately, Independent confirmation arrived from our housekeeper today:"
"Our private areas: 1. Stairway to 4 of our 5 staterooms 2. Lower deck hallway 3. Enteance to @theemrsmcafee and my room 4. The full tragedy of our room . We have a full time housekeeper. Janice, however, refuses to let her into our room. Can anyone explain this to me?"
World famous videographer Robert king  @Thefotoking  kicking back after a snare trap involving Marmots was accidently fouled by himself .
"One of my followers asked for a badass piece of memorabilia. My reply: . Badass?? Memorabilia?? No such thing. You want memorabilia or you want badass? Badass would be a kilo of cocaine. Memorabilia would be the bag labelled ""flour"" that it came in. We throw that shit away."
"The prior tweet:  What floored us was the fact (if true) that I was running for Potus in Exile. Upon careful examination, the ""exile"" part seemed intuitively obvious. We continue with extreme scepticism about the ""Potus"" part. However, if true, I will do my best."
Our attorneys told us to sober up - A fresh look at the world around us. We first checked  Shelton into rehab. We did not notice that every photo of him was identical to this: The owner of the Yacht Club broke the news that I was running for Potus in exile. We're dealing with it.
To clarify (Sorry: we're on an island where alcohol is the only entertainment): I want to make clear that whether I am using the term hackable or unhackable - Bitfi is the most secure wallet ever created. it's a big step up from cold storage. Look into it
"I promote - i think more important than any other glue in a venture. You could build a functioning time machine and without promotion either consumers would prefer a toaster, or the cinsumer would prefer the time machine built by the  Chinese with your plans and promoted properly"
"Bitfy agreed their wallet was hackable. Everything is. I promoted it as unhackable, as asked - a challenge. If i promote something I promote fully. If I promoted my own virtue and @theemrsmcafee caught me in bed with a woman i would deny it. If i survived."
"The chaos appears to be resolving itself into something comprehensible - not by me me of course, but someone suggested that the Norwegian gentleman in room 4 of the Yacht Club might have grasped our situation. There are young people kneeling in the grass  outside his room."
"People say I would be tough on the Russians. Nonsense. I long to have a drinking contest with Putin, and I have already registered with the 2020 Vladivostok public dick measuring contest, where, due to an extremely rare genetic deformity, I will, unquestionably win"
Chaos. Pure chaos. Too much of the evil Gin. Too little to do. Too few to do it with. Chaos
"So .... do you want a tattooed President in 2020? If so, given the likely field of candidates, I can pretty much guarantee you won't get one."
I'll be on radio with Glenn Beck in ten minutes. Listen at:
My favorite comment/reply pair from the previous post of Rocco Castoro's video request for me.
"This personal tweet to me from Rocco Castoro, who was Senior Editor of Vice Magazine when he accompanied documentarian Robert King on my escape from Belize, asks me to reconsider my decision to un-invite him on this escape. What do you guys think?"
"The ""Chill"" festival 8s coming :"
"The blues in Georgetown, Exumas, Bahamas. The blues."
An article from Crypto Insider. How did they get inside by the way? I didn't let them in. And how long have they been inside? I hadn't noticed them here. Hmmmm. Maybe we're outside and don't know it.
".@Thefotoking documented my escape from Belize for Vice Magazine. He's had a camera in my face ever since. Here is his first clip of our leaving the US in advance if the Grand Jury, which was convened on the 22nd"
I need you America. I just don't need your vote.
"Forbes Magazine called me an ""Influencer"". I wish @theemrsmcafee knew that. I certainly have no influence at home. And elsewhere the only influence I seem to have is getting people to willingly raise their glasses in a toast so they can fill them again."
Great F---ing article about my campaign. Rare. The media usualy snorts my dirty underwear or rummages through my garbage to get a story. Have no idea where this came from.
"Meme from David Sheridan. My clones, by the way, are getting organized. @yungkitty404  chose my face from a photo taken in Toronta. I'm kind of looking forward to all of this."
"It's an odd crowd running for Potus in 2020. Maybe we should all run together, then on inauguration day we all take a 4 year vacation"
Been MIA for a couple of days. All is well. Been installing Internet at HQ
Photos by our resident Documentarian- @Thefotoking
"Questions regarding my platform, policies, etc. are answered on my official campaign website. Please check there before asking questions in the comments sections."
Washington Examiner now reporting on our Campaign in Exile. We have arrived I guess.
"Recruiting campaign volunteers for Exile Headquarters in Georgetown, the Exumas. Must be self supporting. Have made arrangements with locals for reasonable housing and lodging. Email 2020exile@gmail.com for details. 3 rooms left in the yacht club - $1,200/month, many in town:"
"My co-operation with Azhos has been the most fulfilling yet. @maguk1618 is one if the brightest thinkers in Europe and I have learned a lot from him about finance, banking and currencies. His project will revolutionize the world of finance. Here is from his recent tweet:"
"In submitting T-shirts, please show the actual shirt with you wearing it. I won't accept just a slogan, image or phrase."
"People asking about the status of campaign T-shirts. Forgive me. I've been running and unable to attend to it. You will have to go shirtless, or make your own with Magic Marker, lipstick or whatever is available. In fact - submit them and I will choose three as official T-shirts."
"The only news agency to get film, out of thousands of agencies, was Stone's greatest enemy - CNN. people are telling me I don't understand how raids work. I have been raided by five different governments. Here was my most recent. Wake the fuck up America!!"
"Anerica: please ask yourself: Grand Juries have the tightest secrecy in the World. How then did our most liberal news agency - CNN - happen to be present for Robert Stone's ""secret"" arrest, and why did Nancy Pelosi have a prepared statement ready to release? Wake up people!!!!"
"Jena Friedman - @JenaFriedman  - is doing a special on me next week. Was filmed months ago. It was risky because she is not fond of me, but it was a fun interview. In her Salon Magazine interview she had this to say:"
"From PopDust: ""Software programmer. Tech entrepreneur. Yoga guru. IRS dodger. Presidential candidate. Drug dealer. Murder suspect. Whale fucker. The world's most eccentric millionaire is best known for his least interesting accomplishment."" Love it."
My wife has been making friends with the black tip sharks circling our boat. Not sure what she has in mind. I've been good to her. I can only hope those clothes donated to Goodwill by the IRS and purchased by her (and thrown in the water) have something to do with it.
"I feel so sorry for taking on this obligation. Here I am - stuck with this weather, bland view, and boring people who rhink only if dancing singing and partying. I would gladly trade this in for an airless, artificially lit cubicle that those lucky IRS agents are gifted with."
Chepicap catches up with me. I reveal my knowledge of support from the CIA - not surprising since the CIA is the IRS's favorite target. See: bad deeds eventually do catch up with you.
"I'm getting flack for taking on the IRS. I am well aware that I am pointing fingers at the most beloved and cherished of our institutions, and that most if you revere the the IRS as the foundation stone of freedom. However.... to those trashing me ... F#@&amp; you."
"Local Bahamians Googled me and came up with the ""Folk Hero"" label given by the Inquirer. Bahamians love a folk hero. Free drinks for me today"
"""John MacAfee cultivated a reputation for irreverence and law-breaking, and is running for president. He’s doing it from a boat because he's also running from the government.""  Why can""t anyone spell my name right?"
The Enquirer called ne a folk hero. That's kind of like an endorsement from Charles Mansom. But I'll take what I can get.
Roger Stone should have come with me. I suspect this breakfast would be more welcome than whatever he is having. To be clear: he is obviously a victim of the Grand Jury system. They are only convened when prosecutors know their quarry is innocent.
At the start of the first Gulf War I donated $40 mil worth of software to the Pentagon. I have supported every covert nilitary agency in the US. None will co-operate with my illegal kidnapping. We are left with law. No country in the world would extradite me. This is political.
Playing harmonica
"ABC news published the first mainstream report of my campaign in Exile. I have worked with Matt Guttman many times before. He is, as all mainstream media moguls, naive in the extreme. But his heart, rare for the media, is in the right place."
"The Express has written a decent story of our Exile. For me, it is a story of the true spirit of America, which, of necessity, must be in exile. It cannot co-exist with the corrupt reality eating away at freedoms we all know are inherent in our existence."
"Awesome article on our exile. Only bad info is that the Grand Jury has convened but has not yet issued an indictment - a formality. Grand Juries are merely a rubber stamp for prosecutors. It's coming. Tomorrow, next week, the next - it's coming."
Waiting on the tide and enjoying my ravorite canapes. Peanut butter and Lobster. My own creation.
"We have arrived at our home for the foreseeable future. Marley, our regal Kommodore, actually deigned to lift his head for something other than eating - sensing, possibly, something historic in the air. I certainly sense it."
"The pups and i under way in blue water. No more secrets. We are going to Georgetown in the Exumas where a Bahamian lawyer will begin our just case against extradition until my campaign is finished. Political crimes are universally exempted. If this is not political, then what is?"
"The Freedom Boat is a 74"" fishing yacht built 20 years ago by Buddy Davis - still America's greatest boat maker. It is four levels high. 1 - staterooms, 2 - salon and kitchen, 3 - enclosed flybridge. 4- tuna tower. Bruce took this from the tuna tower while underway this morning."
"Warning: sites are cropping up asking for contributions to my defense fund. i have no association with these sites and DO NOT CONTRIBUTE. How many times have you seen posts using my name to promise you a full Bitcoin if you will just send me 0,1 BTC, case made:)"
"Freedom Boat's Manifest, . - 1 old man - 7 brave soldiers - 1 Italian Captain - 1 Documentarian - 431 lbs. of dog - 1 terrifying Black Woman - enough weapons and ammo - food for 6 months - 1,834 quarts of booze - no drugs"
"The previous video was filmed by world famous videographer and reporter Robert King. We agreed to allow him tol accompany us for the next 18 months. We are close to a similar deal with CBS news. If the IRS cintinues its illegal activities, it will be recorded for all to see."
A taste of what we are going through. The long arm of the corrupt elements of the US Government reaches the far ends of the earth in unexpected ways. My charisma and the veracity of our story has so far overcome every threat by the IRS. God bless the honor of the Bahamians.
"Tommy has been one of my greatest supporters. If this tweet is true, which to the best of my knowledge it is, then it certainly does not hurt our cause."
"I do not know hiw many days the Grand Jury wlill deluberate, but the day that the indictments are returned you will see my Doppelgangers released on the streets of America."
"Wow!!! Support from the least expected places: a ""retired"" CIA Station Chief. (There are no retired CIA agents.)"
"A brief clip of Freedom Boat's captain - Alessandro Rossi - who came to America from Italy to make a better life. He signed on wuth us because, like us, he saw that the soul of America so beautifully packaged in our Constitution by our founding fathers, has been eaten away."
Freedim Boat coming into port this morning with  one engine. Just a brief look at the weather we dealt with.
"Im not sayung that i don't enjoy the sense of beautiful things. It's just that i have never felt that they were ""mine"". Legally they seldom were. Even when they were legally ""mine"", i never once felt a sense of ownership anywhere near my sense if ownership over my own body."
"I will accept NO campaign contributions. FEC regulations gaurantee that only the two main parties can financially afford contributions. However, many have started defense funds for my trial. My banks are not releasung my funds. Search for these defense funds if you want to help."
"The day ended well. Freedon Boat is having parts flown in, and I am meeting tonight with foreign authorities who, to my understanding, will see my struggle with our government as political persecution and, as such, is exempt from their exteadition treaty with the US."
"Russian Television wrote a supportive article about my war with the corrupt parts of our US Government. The IRS will now label me an ""Agent of the Russian State"". Clearly, if @theemrsmcafee admits she has no control over me, then God help the Russians."
"Mixology 101. The :Rickarita on the Run"""

"The ""Freedom Boat"" survived a stormy night at sea and lost an engine. We reached safety, and brought with us a symbol of freedom recognized around the world. I want to restore that symbol to a position of reality once again."

"Please people ..  don't get distracted by trivialities such as ""am I eligible to be President?"" Remember: i do not want to be president! I just want the stage. I just need to run. I did it once before in The Libertarian Party. Who cares whether I can?? I'm fucking doing it now!!"

"The flybridge on our boat makes it the tallest boat in the Atlantis Marina. One of our shephars, Axel, has taken charge of the aft deck docking station. He's waiting, i think, until we disembark for Venezuela in 4 hours at which time he and the other pups are hijacking the boat."

Our boat captain - Alessandro. He's Italian and unwisely challenged me to a drinking contest. We weighed the option of carrying him to his room or leaving him where he lay. Too tired to carry.
"18 miles off the coast of Newfoundland, Tequila falls off the boat. Temperature of the seawater was 31 degrees.  We hauled her in within a matter of seconds. Unprotected survival time at these temperatures is less than four minutes. She is fine."

Get ready for the McAfee 2020 meme war. Here are samples from our last meme war. The bar to beat. Submit to @Loggiaonfire
"Mixology 101: how to make the ""Whale Fucker"":"
"IRS part 3: The IRS never bothered to audit me, in spite of years of not filing. Why? Because an audit would have uncovered nothing irregular and charges would be impossible. Instead they can now assume and concoct whatever story suits them. This is the hallmark of corruption."
"IRS part 2: At no point did I use exchanges. I transacted with other Team Mcafee folks, using trackable coins, who in turn handled any exchanges. I did not want the IRS to loose track of my funds by moving coins to an untrackable Exchange wallet. My finances are open and visible."
"In preparation for my battle with the IRS: I purposely never transacted using privacy coins. Nor anyone in Team McAfee. We exclusively used Ethereum, Bitcoin and other trackable coins. It is impossible to hide transactions using these coins. Wallets are open to anyone's view."
"An example of my previous point, alledging that profanity enriches cimmunucation: A person wants to convey the emotional depth of a statement -  They could ssy: ""I strongly believe we should impeach Trump"" -or- ""Impeach the motherfucker"". To me the second one conveyed more truth."
"Profanity! Offensive? Or a languge tool? Watch an interview on broadcast TV - no profanities. Watch the same person, provided they use profanities, on a podcast. The second interview demands more attention. We 'intone"" words for emphasis. Profanity is a modulator. Grow up America"
"I angered the folks at   That was'nt my intent. And I don't want to belittle the suffering of the families of the young men killed or maimed attempting to copulate with a whale. However, i used 'whalefucker' to draw attentiion. I will continue. Forgive me."
"The world is aguast that congresswoman Rashida Tlaib used the word 'motherfucker' in public, and to the press snd about our President. Wait til they get a load of me!"
"My whale fuckung manifesto is being increasingly displayed on road signs, bar menus, marquis and fake Seventh day Adventist promotional foldouts. This is a good thing. If you want to psrticipate in its disbrution while being educated about its purpose, contact @Loggiaonfire"
"We declared our independence from Britain and fought a bloody war to escape burdensome taxes, yet here we are, less than 250 years later, being burdened by income taxes that are more crushing than anythung rhe British dreamed of.  Free yourselves people!"
"Please people .   . This is NOT an acceptable way to fuck a whale. Those who indulge in compassionate whale fucking do so while the whale is resting on the surface, diving underneath to perform the deed. I do not approve of the act depicted here. Courtesy of @ChinaMan_123"
"Fox News reported that i don't pay taxes. The IRS is angry (and corrupt). They will strike using law, twisted by 'their' facts, as a club. My offense is small and won't do. inferences of conspiracy or foreign collusion, or something, will come. I promise."
"Back to whale fucking: I've been researching what might drive young men (mostly Pacific Islanders) to join secret whale fucking societies. Turns out that whale vaginas are oddly compatible with human penises, plus, they seem designed for mysterious fun: ."
"My Crypto goals drive the IRS mad. Privacy coins will obsolete income taxes. Can't tax money you cant see, and I promote this as a good thing. The SEC is legally failing in their power grab so It's up to the IRS now to silence me. I've called them out. They will come. You'll see."
"First shipment of McAfee 2020 camaign pins came in today. Contact @Loggiaonfire, our campaign manager, to find out what hoops you must jump through and how many firstborn children you would have to part with in order to acquire one."
I have not filed a tax return for 8 years. Why? 1: taxation is illegal. 2: I paid tens of millions already and received Jack Shit in services. 3. I'm done making money. I live off of cash from McAfee Inc. My net income is negative. But i am a prime target for the IRS. Here I am.
I'm challenging the agency responsible for fueling our Government's madness - the IRS. The IRS will not sit idly by. I know this. But i have prepared my entire life for this battle. We will not be able to shrug off the yoke of this corrupt and insane government without a struggle
"No one will fuck with the enormous power of the IRS. It emerged as an SS like intimidation arm of the government during prohibition - when drinking alcohol was a crime. Unable to buy legitimatte alcohol the publuc relied on family stills. From destrying stills, it now destroys us"
"A solution to Charles Nader's charater flaw -- wherever he goes he is followed by swarms of women more desperate for his attention than the greatest rock star. If he lives with me, on this post apocalyptic island, his problems will disappear. The nearest woman is 100 miles away."
"I'm done trashing the SEC. Let's move on to the IRS - the agency that takes from you an average of three months of your labor each year. First - taxation is theft. It is unconstitutional. Prior to the civil war there was no income tax, yet we managed. Stay tuned for the truth."
"I am going to Japan on the 27th of this month to keynote thre Japan Blockchain Comference. This is my first Japanese Crypto talk and I am excited. For those who generally come to my conferences and for all others, this is the premiere Asian Crypto event."
I warned everyonw more than a dozen times. Don't sign up. Don't use it. Withdtaw your funds. I was trashed for calling out HitBT as a corrupt cimpany. Tough shit. You had six months warning from me to withdraw your funds. Do not ask me to help you now.
.@theemrsmcafee came home yesterday. Had this. (Only gone ten days. I would've used a man purse). Suspicious!? Couldn't sleep. What's in it? Bomb? Midget assasin? Ex wife? Could be anything. I put it out at 3 AM. Guards sleeping. Let them deal. This morning?? Was just bad drugs.
"Happy New Year. We are at the only bar open for 100 miles, on an Island that, at this time of year, is the most desolate stretch of land in America. From the heart of this desolation, the fullness of our hearts overflows, creating a tributary of the River 2019. May it reach you."
"Enough of the ""Whale Fucking is non-consensual"" bullshit. A Humpback Whale weighs 70,000 pounds, is fifty feet long, can dive more than a quarter mile and can crush ships with a single swipe of its tail. If a human manages to fuck one, you damn well better believe it's consensual"
"There is no security whatsoever in this world of universal access and facility, except your own common sense and a firm understanding of the human condition. Everyone, at some point, lies, decieves, hides, covets and feels envy, greed and jealousy. Act accordungly."
"People ask me what secure message app they should use. . If you're not dealing drugs, trafficking humans or tearing labels off mattresses, does it matter? If more than one person knows a secret it will not remain a secret no matter how securely it is transmitted to the world."

"I keynote the Japan Blockchain Conference Jan 31st.  My friend @atsushi530, founder of Patron,    helped organize it. He's smater than me. That's why he thought to add the Blockchain  to Influencers tools and i didn't. Forbes named him a top ten in Crypto."
"Disbelievers about the legality of carrying the previous post's gun on an airplane: i have fancy guarantee, in broken English,  from the company. And . . they sent a letter, in Polish, signed in blue ink, instructing Homeland Security not to interfere. So the last laugh's on you."
A friend showed me this weapon on a Web page.. Supposedly legal in all 50 States. Can fly commercial with it without declaring. Supposedly.  Fully auto. $180. Asked Karl how it works. He claims cartridges contain massively compressed hydrogen. No gunpowder? I think I'll hide it.

Good article about Congression Bill to prevent the SEC from interfering with Crypto.
"On the ""Larry and Joe Show"". As usual, I let it all hang out with these guys. I went way beyond my limits on this one however. This is my Christmas gift to my followers - for any willing to spend the time required to unwrap it."
WAKE THE FUCK UP!!!!! . i didn't know what else to call it. You lazy Mofo's can start at 1:30.
"""The McAfee Effect"".  . Was the introduction of a Congressional Bill to prevent the SEC from interfering with Crypto timed to coincide with the only public voice calling the SEC to task? You decide:"
"Coinsbank -- ever supportive of me and my actions -- gifted me this 1938 Soviet Tokarev TT33 - used against Nazism in WWII. A Christmas present. It is in virtually new condition, was owned by a high ranking Soviet officer, and, as such, is truly priceless.  Thank you CoinsBank."
Merry Christmas from one if my companies -- Luxcore:
"Crypto, for the first time, has given us control over currency. With such freedom comes responsibility --- for yourself. If you are scammed, you cannot blame the scammers. Blame yourself. If you cannot do that you do not belong here."
Finally!!! The sane elements of our government are introducing laws to restrict the SEC. The laws will legally prevent the SEC from interfering in any way in the workings of the Crypto world. About fucking time!!!
"The SEC - that corrupt, seeping pustule scarring the face of America - is put down by the Justice System. They need to be shut down and replaced by people who are not burdened by arrogance, a thirst for power and indifference toward the American public:"
"Bitcoin $4,100. Alt coins are cranking. The general mood is elevated. Business deals are flourishing. Is the Bull in town? Looks, smells and feels like it. Are you ready for it people?"
"Folks are warning me against opposing the SEC and point to Elon Musk's submission to them as an example I should follow. I have had many dances with the SEC. I know who they are, and I am not Elon Musk - I'm John Fucking McAfee. Watch the difference."
"Want to involve yourself in my Potus campaign but can't tolerate structure, organizations, bosses, approvals, restraints? We are a distributed campaign. Our message will come from you, the people. Here's how it works:"
In 2016 I was hassled by the FBI. It gave cause for National news to take interest. I debated the FBI on CNN and tore them apart. I am waiting patiently for the SEC to tangle with me. My destruction of their illegal involvemt with Crypto will be extreme.
"The SEC loses its first legal battle in its unlawful quest to regulate the Crypto space. As I pointed out, they have no lawful right to interfere with us. I can hardly wait for them to tangle with me. We are winning people."
"Bitcoin now over $4,000. It's looking more and more like the market has turned. If it has turned, this is only the beginning. Perhaps 2019 will be the year future generations will look back on and name: ""the year of emergence""."
"A power player visits for Christmas. But more important,- my Chrstmas message to all of you, whom I love:"
"Do not panic at any dip in Bitcoin's price. If this is a Bull Market then these dips will happen frequently -- profit taking, nervous new investors etc. Look at any Bull market. It is not a straight line. It's: up a good amount, down less. Up a good amount, down less. Relax."

First press about my Safex Mining App:
"Bitcoin at $3850. Tide may be turning. Alt coins accelerating even faster. Today's winner is Skycoin: up 45%. My Skycoin tattoo was prophetic. It takes time, but the coins I choose, eventually, tend to win. Keep your fingers crossed folks. Last week may have been the time to buy."
"I have only one issue in my platform. Many are baffled. No Potus candidate before has refused to address things like Immigration, the Israeli/Palestinian problem,  Farm subsidies, medical insurance, etc. Sounds insane, or even laughable. Hopefully this will enlighten you:"
How to contribute to my campaign? We're not sure that we will accept contributions. I learned in 2016 how powerful and paranoid the Federal Elections Commission is - and how dangerous.The US gov. has been trying to fault me for years. I'm not sure I can risk accepting donations.
"*replaced*  The McAfee Campaign Discord Channel is a place to start if you want to find out more about my campaign or if you think you might want to volunteer, or, if you want to trash me publicly and get no satisfaction from trolling my Twitter account."
"Ours is the first decentralized POTUS campaign. No bosses here. Each volunteer is their own decision maker. Campaign headquarters is just a network server and help center. If you want to volunteer, read the following. It explains how it works:"
"(Replaced, wrong video)  Intel is selling McAfee. Yes, again. I fully expect to be sued again to prevent me from using my name. I sort of won the last one. Why do I fight Intel? Here's the truth:"
A government that has turned the intent of its creators upside down. A government that has gone insane. A government that needs to be replaced. Treasonous words? Time will tell:
Filming the lead-in with Jena Friedman for an upcoming Adult Swim segment. God only knows what twisted story she is going to tell about me:
"You doubt my willingness to go head to head with the corruption in our Government? When the FBI illegally demanded that Apple give them a back door into the iPhone, I challenged them to debate me in CNN. They unwisely agreed. I ripped them a new asshole:"
"Jeff Wise, producer of the hit-piece ""documrntary"" - Gringo - and author of tons of negative stories about me, made me his life's work. His latest nonsense is a massive, negative story about me in New York Magazine. How tragic to have only one interest."
Yhose offering to volunteer for my campaign please contact Rob Loggia @Loggiaonfire. He is my campaign manager. He was critical to my 2016 Potus run. He is a powerhouse of Intellect and is the most fearless person I know. He will stretch your limits and guarantee an adventure.
"Free yourselves from the current burden we all share: a government that was created to serve us that has instead become our master. How? By replacing the system used to control us - currency - with a system that we, the citizens control: Cryptocurrencies."
What will my Potus campaign look like when I roll it out in January? Well . . . . . I will be using Twitter as my initial National Stage. And expect to be shocked. It is the quickest expedient to wake up the sleeping masses:
The L A. Times characterized my Potus run as an attempt to out-crazy Trump. Little do they know. My crazy scale is off the charts. I'm not out crazying anyone. I am attempting to bring sanity to to the slaves of the insane government we have created and allowed to exist.
"Beginning in January, I will kick off my campaign for POTUS in earnest. Expect to see vids way more intense than this example from my 2016 run."
The McAfee Safex Mining pool is now up and running.   Safex miners now have a hedge.
"People say I'm addicted. I won't argue. People who classify other people as ""addicted"" cannot be argued with. I will say this: if I'm addicted it's not to alcohol or any specific drug. I swap them out like I change suspenders. It would be to the lifestyle that accepts all this."
"We are locked in prisons of thought, shaped by manipulations of the powerful to create sheep. Drugs and alcohol break the conditioning that creates the bars of our prisons. They are a threat to our jailers. The ""War on Drugs"" is a war against us. Uncondition yourselves. Be free."
"My yesterday's Mixology is pushing 300,000 views. The number one comment is ""I am learning so much Mr. McAfee""  let me disillusion you: I am not here to teach. I am here to help you unlearn everything that this twisted world has taught you - through culture, education and media."
Sunday Mixology: how to drink when you need a drink but need to be civilized. I'm including a link to Amy Herbert's confession on Dateline about trying to slash my throat with a straight razor - critical to understanding this video.   . .

I need to confess the depth of my foolishness. I do everything in the extrene. It's my negative actions and attitudes that I stretch way beyond the extreme. I believe you will find this confession helpful in your own lives.
"People half my age constantly advise me: Dont smoke or use drugs, etc. My advice:    not advise your elders, We are here to advise you.   2. If you've no self control and are compelled to advise, then don""t advise what everyone already knows. I have a brain."
"The John and Ricky Show -- a Christmas special, from Ricky to all of you. You are lucky people. No simpler, more direct nessage on how to live is available, at any price."
"I did little for technology. What I did was for myself: experiment, test limits, invite fearful challenges, ignore naysayers, attempt the impossible, drop all constraints, believe, hope. And, when the worst happened  danced with it, apologized, and memorized the lesson."
"Intel selling McAfee Inc for the second time. No matter who buys it, they still have to deal with the inevitable association with the disreputable bad boy of technology - me. Everyone has a cross to bear. I am Intel's."

Coinsbank has announced dates for their Summer Blockchain Cruise. June 9th -13th. It's my favorite thing in the entire Cryptosphere. It's a combo of Blockchain Conference and Party Central. Brock Pierce and myself break partying records on these cruises.

"None believe this is Sammy's birthday.  But we did compromise and agreed to take him to dinner provided he paid for everyone. The deal was cut. Here we are. Most of our staff is home for the Holidays. Dont get any ideas. All at this table are heavily armed, including Miss Vicky."
"Ricky and I in the first episode of ""Life on Helium"" - ""H"" for short. Now remember folks, just like the other ""H"", only the first episode is free."
(I posted the wrong video earlier) . @theemrsmcafee and I had rough beginnings. For the first 2 and 1/2 years she occupied herself by working with the people who were attempting to kidnap me and return me to Central America. This video tells why Janice and I are still together.
And heer's another example. Please people -- see that Crypto in reality us booming. This Bear market will have no choice other than to boom into one of greatest Bull runs ever.
Even Bigger news: the Samsung S10 will integrate Cryptocurrency cold storage into the phone. Has Samsung ever made a strategic miscalculation? I think not. Crypto is not just here to stay. It is taking over. Listen market -- you damn well better keep up.
"Opera for Android contains a secure Crypto wallet. Soon, all browsers will support Crypto. In spite of the market, Crypto  continues it's real growth. There is no stopping it. Soon, the market will have to catch up with reality."

Answering questions about “Gringo” - the Showtime movie about myself produced by my arch enemy Jeff Wise. I've received thousands of questions. The video references the following if anyone has any interest at all.
"Ricky Taylor, our handyman, was just promoted to Vice President of Booze for Team McAfee. Accept these off-topic tweets folks. Crypto is suffering a severe Bear Market. Can't pump. Can't promote. Can't say or do anything that's positive. But it will end. When it does, watch out."
"showing their product in Amsterdam. Chaotic video, but it shows their fuel tank measuring device at least. Connected to the Blockchain, these measuring devices provide real time asset quantities that banks can lend money on. A new tech for Chemicals."
Ever ask whether your wife or your dog loves you more? I suggest you lock your dog and your wife in the trunks of separate cars for a day. Then let them out. The dog will be happy as hell to get out - face licking. Tail wagging happy. How will your wife react? Point made.
"""Know Thyself"" - Delphic Oracle - allegedly, though, how would we fucking know? History is fiction, populated by heroes and villains that became such through warfare - creating the conquered (villains) and conquerors (heroes). The heroes wrote history, yet it's not a heroic story"
"Came across an article published today titled ""Who is John McAfee?"" I'm interested in this question, and have read a dozen or so similarly titled articles, so I read the whole thing, hoping for some enlightenment. No such luck. Maybe you'll fare better."
"I joined Azhos, the first company that enables Supply Chain Finance based on Blockchain-Technology for the Chemical Industry. It frees up capital by synchronizing the flow of goods with the flow of finance. This is new tech. I'm excited for their launch!"
".@got_think had an idea. Shirt logos (re::race car drivers) with campaign  sponsors for those running for Potus. I have none but will make some up. Imagine a candidate shirt with ""Executive Pardons Lobby"", ""Rich White Men Society"" and ""Exxon"" emblazoned on it.  I'm doing it."
"Disclosure: I'm a partner in the Maecenas Blockchain art auction project - the company auctioning the Picasso in my prior post. There is little happening of importance in the Crypto space that I'm not part of. If I tweet, assume I'm vested. How's that?"
Tokenizing real word assets. Wave of the future? Not? I think it is.
"I've been invited, among some 2,000 folks around the World, including Trump, Putin, celebrities and the janitor at the Ritz Carlton San Juan, to grace the premises of the World Economic Forum in January - allegedly the World's most exclusive gathering. Someone made a big mistake."

"How am I making out? I'm asked that and there is no answer. I don't know about you, but in my life there is just dancing and music. The music is not mine and doesn't matter. Am I dancing or am I not?. That's the only question and the answer: I'm still dancing."
The soul of promotion: Promotion shines a light on reality that most will never see without the road signs created by it. @theemrsmcafee and myself at 2:00 A.M.
"A friend of mine will be organizing a mug shot competition in February. I have many, so my chances of winning  are better than most.  I think this one, from a DUI a few years back, might garner top place in the 'Best shows the true character of the miscreant"" category."
"What do you think ""permissionless"" means? It is the foundation of the Blockchain. We are building the first truly free thing humans have ever done. You cannot be free and at the same time be regulated. Fools will always loose. We cannot save them.."

Heartfelt feelings from Jimmy Watson.
U jumped the gun when I divulged the Skycoin video that someone shot during the week of revelry at my place. Seems there is a remix now. Great improvements plus without the shot of Hayden with his dick hanging out.   (link:
"The Skycoin folks stayed with me for a week. In the fog of booze, drugs and prayer someone made a video. There are many serious players in Crypto. Skycoin is certainly one of them. Assuming that the ones who came really were with Skycoin. If not, whoever they're with is serious."
My attempt to entertain you in in a Bear Market. Be gracious to an old man.
"The war with the power hungry, corrupt agencies withn our government is on. The SEC asserts that it can interfere with cryptocurrency and its financial dealings. It cannot. The fines against @FloydMayweather and @djkhaled were lawless actions. The money must be returned"
A brilliant reason why Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies cannot be regulated by the U.S. Government. Everything is text. Stored on the blockchain. Readable by all. Containing information that many need to know. Therefore: protected by the first amendment.
"Too many have diss'd my shirtlessness. Get used to it and more. I'm starting a movement: ""Elderly people:Go naked! It's the ultimate revenge on the young, who have all done their best to annoy the fuck out of us.:"
Mixology 101. Bruce's magic:
How to fight back? Here's one way: File a complaint with the FBI stating that a rogue agency of the US government has been extorting members of your community. Tell them you fear for your safety. Suggest the the agency was infiltrated by terrorists. Repeat with your local police.
Why am I alone in fighting back? Our leaders stew in anger or run scared while the SEC illegally takes control of us. Crypto is not a security. The SEC has no jurisdiction. It simply smelled the future and wanted to own it. I will not stand for it.
The SEC subpoenaed me in 2016. It was not about me or my company. It was about one stockholder. We had to disclose that we had been subpoenaed. We legally could not disclose its contents. The World assumes. The NYSE dropped us. Shareholders lost millions. That's the SEC's power.
"I can't help anyone, and there is no possibility that I could be elected president. I will make this clear in my first Libertarian debate. Neither will I address any national issues except one: how can we, as citizens, be free from a government that controls rather than serves."
"Is the SEC toxic to the investment environment in Amefica? Not just America. That seeping postule of an agency reaches to every corner of the earth, turning creativity, hard work and honest ventures into withered trophies."
"Me? Worried about the SEC? I have openly, publicly and in the media ridiculed that corrupt, puss filled, bile dripping abcess on the fabric of America. Come for me SEC. I will, in every media outlet in this country, rip you a new asshole worthy of parking a tractor trailer in."
"Yes. I said Crypto leaders are dull. A top Crypto quote begins: ""When the interests of protocol ------"". Quantum physicists (overtly  stale), at their last conference, threw out: “i was bad insane”, “Rehab is a landfill” and “Who fucks the same Ho twice?”"
"I should also introduce my campaign manager - @Loggiaonfire. Brilliant, effective, creative, diabolical. Never sure which way the wind blows with him. I refer you volunteers to him. Unclear whether he responds, or ignores you and instead strong arms some unfortunate stranger."
Made the cover of BlockJournal Magazine. A Chinese group. I think. I mean - they talked funny and all. Of course they could be Polish. Polish talk funny too. And tell funny jokes. But ..... these folks didnt tell jokes. I suppose they must be Chinese. Gotta hurry. Need a drink.
"Lazy? We have campaign titles - no duties. From $25 for a ""Coordinator"" to $500 for a ""God of"" title, for which you may choose your own realm or subject. We will also list you on our campaign website under under the category: ""People Too important To work"". Contact @Loggiaonfire"
"I was reminded by Yung Zoe @yungkitty404 that I have not announced her as my campaign boss for that tribe if hooligans we call Millenials. Zoe is brilliant, astute, hard working and influential. However, like all Millenials, she wants it now. It was in my 5 year plan. Why hurry?"
"I changed my profile pic to half real, half avi. By an 18 point margin, my followers want me to use an avi. The half/half seems ok. For reasons that mystify me, I have a huge Millenial following. Anime avis are much loved in this massive subculture of Americans. Bear with me."
"It's clear that people want an Avi. So, I was granted an audience with @tommyp408, and while lying prostrate, face down, at the feet of this fearful and powerful God, he took pity on me and granted the impossible. ""Thou shalt, henceforth, please everyone"" he said. He gave me this"
My good friend Tommy Mustache asked me to retweet this. There will be a quiz later this afternoon on its content. A score of below 70 us a fail.
"Now then. My Millenial consultant for my Potus campain convinced my to change my profile pic. Many of my followers are Millenials. They will, in fact be inheriting our world soon, like it or not. So. Which is it?"

"Been waiting to post this interview with Coin Telegraph for a day such as this. Green Zones bring optimism, smiles, joy. On a day like today you might appreciate the interviewer and the content. I, of course, am as dull as always in my interviews."
"We have our second day in the Green Zone people. Can't say for sure that this is the bottom, but if you were going to buy something, you couldn't choose a better day."
"Should have posted this with the prior tweet, in case anyone wants to get involved:"
The Music Industry is more paranoid than me. They have nightmares of Demons with human faces streaming Michael Jackson songs without paying. Fuck em! I helped   last year with seed money. They actually did something with it! Their Beta App is now available.

"The emails, DMs and texts that I receive from my followers, detractors and random strangers would make a fascinating collection of the bizzare and unbelievable. It would be a window into that part the human psyche that orbits Pluto. Today a Ronin spoke. My reply on the right:"
"The CEO of Overstock just noticed the unstoppable growth of Crypto and the Blockchain emerging all around him. Since he is no fool, he jumped on board. Soon, everyone will have to. The tide is turning children. Hold on for the upcoming ride of your life."
Crypto hits the big time! Forbes Magazine released a major story about free Telemedicine and Telepsychology today. What company was their sole focus? Docademic of course. Hard work and promotion always pays.
"My final interview from the Malta Blockchain summit. I post these interviews as obligatory mentions for the interviewing agency. My interviews are generally valueless, and boring on top of that. It's Ok with me if you pretend to watch them and don't."
Looking at temporary options if the Bear Market continues into January. The prerequisites for the below position are 1 - The ability to write on cardboard and 2 - The ability to hold it.
"On this sacred, non-party night, discipline faded - so rapidly- so complete, that I lost hope of retrieval. With a heavy heart, a sad demeanor and a sense of loss so complete, that I knew, in some strange way of knowing,  that things would never be the same. I joined the dancing."
"Tuesday. A scheduled non-party night. In spite of this strict rule, one if my security staff loses it amidst the monumental work being done and breaks into dance. He is being interrogated as I type this."
The community's campaign to boycott questionable exchanges has improved the field. There are a few stragglers however. We are currently reviewing C2CX and are asking anyone with DOCUMENTED complaints against this exchange to send them to alancorwell@gmail.com. Not an indictment.
"We've endured serious chaos revolving around the hot tub. Partiers included a goat two weeks ago, and someone licked a toad, while in the tub, and required medical attention. Two note pads were found fliating and 6 days ago it was filled with folks wearing Black Tie. New rules:"
"I might lie about where I've been all night, whether the drugs belonged to me, whether I'm married,  whether I had sex with with your wife/girlfriend/dog, whether I know the whereabouts of someone, but seriously, why would I lie about losing a whale fucking contest?"
"My obligatory Tuesday morning Crypto Post. I chose this out of the many daily publications who never interview me, but instead base their news entirely on my dubious tweets, primarily because they used the word ""reckons""."
"Some call me ""Whale Fucker"". Alright. There's a private club of a few dozen Maori men and one butch woman - that meet in Molokai each year to fuck a whale. True. Men on padeleboards herd the whale while one tries to fuck it. Wouldn't let me in the club. Tried it alone. Epic fail."
"Cigarettes cause cancer, yes, but there are over 600 ingredients in cigarettes. No one has a fucking clue which one causes cancer. So they tell us - tobacco. If it were tobacco, Native Americans  would be toast. Stop buying lies -- the basis of their controo, and fucking think!!"
I catch the FBI in the act of recording me. Possibly.
There is no such thing as news anymore. Reporters simply read tweets and construct stories - a cushy job. This reporter strung a few of my tweets together and managed to write my actual philosophy about investing. He still didn't do any work tho.
Yet another article claiming Bitcoin Cash ABC is winning the war. It will eventually. Obviously. I'd just like to see a capitulation sooner than later.
It's a tragic situation when people consider my pitiful Twitter talents as something worthy of following. (From last Spring's meme wars)
"The Crypto week in quotes. We need to ratchet up our bland, colorless public comments. We are starting to look like Gsry Johnson clones. (I include me in this embarrassing spectacle)"
"Everyone says just do drinking videos. It's a big temptation but I have serious work to do. And so do you all. One person on the pumps (me) can do little. But as an organized community, we can be the greatest force that exists. You must stop wringing your hands and listen. Now!"
"The crypto market is a zero sum game. Your profit is someone else's loss. We are not Robin Hood's or Angel's of Mercy. We are not standing up for the poor, not building a better world - that's what the developers do. In the Market we are Pirates. We take. Time to get real."
This bridge is an awesome metaphor for a bear market. Thete's no real risk. The danger is all imagined and won't become real unless you sell. The danger is an illusion. All that's required is patience. Hysterically funny video though.
"I'll soon get off my ass. This has been an enjoyable rest and I hate to see it end, but I'm afraid we've eaten everybody that won't fight back, which generally indicates an imminent market turn. I'll have to get back work. So will all of you. Your fear and Loathing will soon end."
Lest someone draw parallels between my comment and the accusations that I ate dozens of small children in Cincinnati in 1978 -- my comment was meant as a metaphor only. I have eaten ni-one. As far as I can remember.
"I have, of course disguised myself as Bob Marley Many times. It worked better than the time I tried to Disguise myself as Madonna, for example."
"As predicted, Jihan is winning the Bitcoin Cash War. Craig warring with Jihan is like Fiji warring with the U.S. There is only one possible outcome. I'm sorry I called Craig an idiot, but what would you call the Ruler of Fiji if he declared war on the U.S?"
"Working with @Loggiaonfire on my campaign. My only focus is freedom through the Blockchain  but focus groups will at least expect a slogan. Feminism came up. I suggested: ""The truth is: I'm not sure how I feel about feminism, but I do promise: I won't grab you by the pussy""."
"The most common request, and one that I am asked about multiple times a day, is for more Mixology videos. Ok then. Here's how to make a ""Why Not""."
Comments suggesting I zip up my pants:  Best not to advise a man who heeds none.
"You've heard the phrase: ""Roll up your sleeves and get to work""? Thar's for 9 to 5 pussies. Motivated players say ""take your whole fucking shirt off""."
"Amazon lost 99% of its value in one drop of the market in its early years. If someone purchased the stock at it's high, just prior to the collapse, and held it, every dollar spent on the stock at it's high would be worth almost $100 today. Words to the wise Crypto investor."
My friend Tommy Mustache put together a chart of previous Bitcoin crashes. Seems we are right on track. The percentage drop is spot on. Must be close to turning around. Thank you Tommy.
"My Thanksgiving Seranade to the Team McAfee staff who stayed here, to my beautiful wife @theemrsmcafee, to our guest Synth - founder of @Skycoinproject and to our pups. Hapoy Thanksgiving."
"Since the Crypto Poll was released, seven media outlets have labelled me ""King of Crypto"". Frankly, I'd rather be the King's sampler of potential consorts. That would be my ideal job."
Synth @Skycoinproject sat in my chair in my office. I sat in the visitor chair. Last persin to do that disappeared minutes later. While I sat contemplating my next course of action he took this photo. I finally decided it was an act.of childlike innocence. I uncocked my weapon.
"Synth, founder of @Skycoinproject, attempting to shoot fish from a tiny boat in rough weather. Our deal was that if he shot no fish, he would hire me back. We just signed a pre-nup for our second chance marriage. I want Synth to get a tramp stamp tattoo with my name. Need help..."
"We've been beamed to an alternate, wickedly twisted reality:   survey of crypto users chose me as the most influential personality in the space, among both Republicas and Democrats and both Millenials and GenX. Not fucking possible."
"I was fired by the prick next to me in this video solely because I had a wonderful idea. When I first heard ""Some ideas are dangerous""  I clearly misunderstood the context."
"I want a secret texting system, where no one can intercept, monitor, record or fuck with my privacy. Can only be done with mesh networks. There are none, except for my client Skycoin. I said: ""Create this system"". I was divorced. Overstepped my bounds. Imagine that."
Dec 12th air date for Luxcore's TV special on the Blockchain and Crypto Currency. Watch it on the History Channel. I have a cameo.
"I'm not alone in advising calm. Nearly every major player in Crypto is telling everyone to relax. The forces pushing prices down are temporary and will soon burn out. In the meantime have a drink, woo your spouse or just take a walk in the sun."
What caused this decline? Confusion. The embarrassment of public brawlings. Fear from institutions who took absurdly unenforceable measures to allay their fears. Uncertainty in the minds of traders. But mostly ignoring the implications of a massively growing base of Crypto users.
ClearPoll is the Blockchain based polling company that my Potus camp is using to keep our fingers on the pulse of America. I want the US to see firsthand how such technology is already being used as a foundation upon which secure voting systems can exist.
"People have panicked. But there's no fucking need. We're in a bear market. They suck, yes, and not like a hooker with no teeth. But I'm 73 and have seen this dozens of times in many markets.  Bear markets are like Winter. It's always followed by a glorious Spring. Fucking relax."
"You know those conversations that arise in a group that's smoked too much? Today I heard, ""Would we be attractive if we all had just one eye? Well .. Depends on where the fucker is. That stretch of flesh between the genitals and the anus, for example, would freak me the fuck out."
"A cool audio interview, allegedly with me, but I can't remember it. Also whomever is claiming to be me, and does sound a little like me, is way too lucid to be me. Also, no matter how stoned I am, I could never forget an interviewer named Lillywhite. QED."
"Scammers are emailing Team McAfee partners claiming to be ex-CEO Jimmy Watson. They range from ""please transfer all coins to this address"" to.""I still work for McAfee - please pay invoices here"" - Jimmy no longer works for Team Mcafee in any capacity. These are scammers."
"The ""Rockstar"" status confuses me. Never seen a notable person in the Blockchain space get on stage for a keynote and sing a song or play guitar. Although, I would pay handsomely to see Vitalik take the stage at a conference and sing ""Gimme Shelter""."
"My security team got new badges today. The antique Texas Rangers star badges, which I purchased in bulk on Ebay for an average cost of $0.83, were made of tin and looked like they came from a cereal box. I thought they were fine, but the boys resented them. Fucking prima donnas."
"Why does the Press hate me? I can't count the fucking stories that characterize me as self destructive. I'm seventy fucking three. If I were truly self destructive, I would have to be incompetent to have failed so badly."
Which side gets my support? Generally it's the side that gifts me the oldest bottle of Scotch.
".@Matthew_Aaron sent me one fine bottle of Scotch. And a book that I am too inebriated to read. The advantage to being a wanton, unapologetic outcast is that others of the same ilk fully support one another. Wanton outcasts have the world's finest Scorch. Thank you Mr. Aaron."
"We're busy tokenizing rare art pieces: The painting that we're tokenizing next month is a Picasso. Frankly, his work bewilders me. Most of the breasts in his paintings have no nipples. What's up with that?"
My interview with Rice Crypto. I must have been stoned because I can't remember doing the interview. It sure looks and sounds like me though. It's a mystery.
Craig Wright claims to be the real Satoshi. He says this believing that no-one knows the truth. He is wrong. I tell you now - the real Satoshi is not Craig Wright.
"Craig Wriight lashes out at  me. Finally, thank God! I was seriously feeling left out."
"This was my 203rd lawsuit. I never answer them. I always default to whatever their lawyers claim. My first wrongful death was due to an airplane that crashed, piloted by my student pilot. I was found liable. I own nothing, and no one has ever collected."
"The war raging around Jihan Wu was started by the egos and short sightedness of the Bitcoin developers. The developers serve the community, not some ideal principal of technology. And they certainly do not control our community. Wake up developers. You could have avoided this."
"The most fun of all of my projects. I love art and to touch a Picasso, a Monet etc. Is a thrill."
"Those who stand against Jihan Wu are a idiots who don't see the realities of the playing field. Please, get real. I will not let my ego destroy me by making me think I could challenge the only real power in this space. My email to him should make it clear to anyone where I stand."
We invade Thai's room looking for weed. The m'f###r clearly thought before he left that we would actually steal from him. . . . .well. . . . . We found it mofo!!
"Some of you say I do not understand politics and should not run for Potus. In 2016 I was immersed in and swam through the morass if lies, deception, vote buying, underhanded tricks, dubious alliances, etc. that defines politics, for almost a year. And I don't understand?"
"If we do not dive fully into Crypto and use the Blockchain as a way to enhance our lives and the world around us, instead of just collecting coins hoping for a Bull market, then our greed will have killed the greatest opportunity yet offered to mankind."
"Alone with the pups and security boys. @theemrsmcafee is away. Janice, armed, is better protection than the pups, but the pups talk less. When we're alone the boys and I might go a whole day without speaking a word. indescribably beautiful. Add a woman and words fly like bullets."
"I grew up in America when the slogan ""Vote you lucky Aneticans!"" was something a person might take to heart. Some 60+ years later, and with more experienced eyes, I see the mechanisms by which we are deluded and controlled by our two party system:"
I am helping to tokenize rare art objects - a groundbreaking Blockchain application. We will auction a tokenized Picasso at the end of December. This is our second tokenized painting. The first was a resounding success. Information can he found here:
"Voters are complicit in the system. Not voting is simply a statement. It does not change the system, it changes you - from a willing participant in madness into a participant in true change"
You say voting for no one is not a solution. Indeed correct. But it is at least a protest and all meaningful change begins in protest.
".@popthunder has kindly written a piece on my Potus run. However, I dont want anyone's vote. In fact I urge you to vote for no one. Voting merely validates the existing corrupt system of politics. Stop supporting the freak show. We need to start over."
"Due to medical reasons, Jimmy Watson has resigned from Team McAfee. Jimmy was a great asset and we will miss him. In the interim I have taken over as CEO. Please work with me during this difficult transition."
The author states that I never do anything at half measures. Anyone who has watched one of mixed drink tutorials can verify that I do things at ten times a full measure.
"Folks from my prior tweet don't believe a beautiful woman would throw themself at a 73 year old man who looks like a shriveled testicle. My wife @theemrsmcafee will   It happens constantly - at conferences, many times a day. Every wealthy man - the same."
"Was at a bar in Hatteras and the waitress quietly passed me a note. ""I want to fuck you"". I didn't respond. I don't trust a woman who doesn't charge money for sex. Pros don't take waitress jobs. Men: if you think, ever, there is such a thing as free sex, then you live in a closet"
The owner of CoinsBank just sent me the bottom picture of Jihan Wu with the Winklevoss Twins. I'm not really short. The Twins are nine feet tall. What hit me was the contrast between Jihan and myself. Hard to believe that I consider him a close friend.
"From Christopher Emms, a Skyminer owner, about using Skyminers in disaster areas where Internet is down. Skycoin has developed an inexpensive point to point wifi antenna with a 25 kilometer range. Combined with a network of miners, a bridge can be created"
My interview with Free Four All. A crazy bunch of guys. Had to cut it short because I had to do my morning Heroin and they didn't want me shooting up on the show:
"Yes, of course, I am working with Skycoin. More than that, I have partnered with them , something I have never before done in the crypto   why:"
"My lovely wife @theemrsmcafee  bought this for me as a ""just because"" present. I'm assuming that it's because I am an awesome lover. At least that's what I am choosing to believe."
"Re: the video in the previous post: I will be posting the real Skycoin video in one hour. Yes, obviously, I am supporting Skycoin. I have actually partnered with them on their Skyminer and some other if their products. I'll tell you why shortly."
"To all of you claiming I am shilling Skycoin (  A ridiculous concept, as this video proves:"
A 30 second segment of my talk from the CoinsBank cruise about the existing power structure. Coinsbank prettied it up with some nice images.
"My campaign manager's summation of my 2020 Potus campaign strategy. A long read -- not recommended for anyone other than the 50 or so of my followers who truly want to change the system, or the one or two of you who are curious why I seem so foolish."
"CoinsBank created one of the best, certainly the most expensive, video that captures the energy, excitement and promise of the Blockchain/Cryptocurrency movement. 5 minutes:"
"People make fun of my stomach. Here's my regimen: Booze, cigarettes, zero exercise and experimental recreational research chemicals. I can skate by on this regimen because I am 73 and most people label the stomach as meaningless compared to the miracle that I am still alive."
I promised the Tattoo Parlor where I got my Skycoin (  tattoo yesterday that I would tweet about them. My mind was hazy yesterday from the drugs and alcohol required to endure the pain of a spinal column tattoo and I forgot. Here it is:
And now . . . . . For the technically minded only: from my LuxCore project: a new distributed file system architecture
I always knew tattoos had value
A tattoo that crosses the spine is at the top of the pain charts. This was my second such tattoo. At one point during my   tattoo I had to reach deep to find the appropriate curse words.
"Josh Case. Founder of Ethershift, visits me and tells the inside story of what really goes on inside ""House McAfee""."
"I got a Skycoin (  tattoo today. My tech folks will stitch a two minute video together that should capture the essence of the experience. For now, this short clip should summarize. Why Skycoin? If you have to ask, you've been living in a fucking closet."
"Well, not everyone should be allowed to use Crypto. The existing power merchants who control our very lives through control of Fiat, for example,  should be forced to continue using Fiat while the rest of us, for the first time in history, free ourselves."
Maybe. Maybe not:
"After careful consideration, I think we should not vote for anyone:"
My Friends at the Ethershift exchange are creating their own token. About time those lazy bastards did this. I've been lobbying for it for months.
"I have been assured that, unlike Johnny Depp, who was removed from the movie, Keaton has the stamina to match, and perhaps even surpass, my legendary drug usage."
"I am on board and partnering with the folks at   and their amazing product line. My heart and mind resonate with their efforts. For those of you who want to trash me and label my efforts as ""shilling"", you may, with my full permission and support, fuck off."
"To free Crypto from the bonds of corrupt power, we need more than distributed exchanges. We need to bypass the existing Internet. Mesh networks solve this problem. Skywire (  is the only one designed by and for the Crypto Space."
"""Don't vote for John McAfee"" will be my campaign slogan as I run for POTUS for the second time:"
"With the Winklevoss twins. Or so they said. I trust nothing. Even though everyone verified their identity, I believe they are clones, and are part of a CIA conspiracy to get me to divulge my secret knowledge of the crypto space. Trust no-one."
I believe strongly that America is one of the greatest countries on earth. But America is NOT its government. It is the people and the land. Please God - never forget this.
I am running for Potus for the second time only so that I can access the national stage. No one in their right mind could possibly believe that I could ever be president. Peter Dinklage would have a greater chance of winning a UFC champiinship.
I met the SkyCoin people -   - at the Malta Conference. They gifted me a Sky Miner. They have some of the best technology in the Crypto Space. I guess I'm a miner now.
The newest Blockchain Magazine. Definitely worth a look.
"They asked me talk at the awards fundraising dinner for the poor at the Malta Summit. I was not prepared, but stood up and and spoke from my own personal experience - from seeing first hand the disparity between the few haves and the many have nots:"
".@ayounggreek, one of my followers, saved my ass prior to my keynote in Malta by running to the bar and getting me a tripple Scotch and water prior to my taking the stage. I downed it during my talk. Thank you my friend."
At the VIP dinner in Malta. I would rather be eating at McDonalds quite frankly.
Sophia's creator - @SimoneSaysIt. I asked him what it felt like to be the God of a new species.
"The VIP dinner setting, complete with harpist and Sophia. This Malta Summit nearly rivals CoinsBank's blockchain cruises. To my good friend Evgenny: you may have to step things up soon:)"
"I met Sophia and her creators at the Malta Summit, which has now grown to over 8,000 participants. I will be headlining the Summit at 3:00 PM tomorrow, Malta Time. I am told there will be multiple live streams of my address for those interested in searching them out."
"5,000 people showed up for the Malta Blockchain Summit. This is by far the most influential and energetic meeting of minds within the crypto community that I have had the pleasure to address. We are growing. We are coming into our power."
"For those trolls who say I was only using Johnny Depp""s name to promote the movie about me  . . . . . No. He was on board for almost a year before being fired. The pussy couldn't handle my drugs. Keaton will have no problem."
From @tommyp408
"I mentor @Cpollo_  and help them list on exchanges. I work with only the best companies, turning down 9 out of every 10 offers to partner up, and CPOLLO is one of the best. Today, CPOLLO is being listed on IDAX. More will soon be coming. Congratulations partner."
"My rejection of Johnny Depp to play me in ""King of the Jungle"" is explained in this story. Already, it seems, personalities in the crypto sphere are flexing muscles that can reach even into the hallowed halls of Hollywood:"
"For my Potus campaign, we have permission to replicate parts of David O'Shea's insightful documentary on  allegations of murder, conspiricy, assassination, kidnapping, drug mfg. etc. against myself. Here it is in full:  McAfee's Murder Mystery   via @YouTube"
"Me and Joshua Davis, the Wired writer who wrote the story about me on which the Michael Keaton movie is based. Josh was naive. I had great fun at his expense."
The script for the upcoming movie is based on Joshua Davis's story about me that he wrote for Wired Magazine in 2013. Joshua was the most gullible and naive man I had ever met. I will post next my favorite photo of the two of us while he was in Belize.
"The Pittsburg shootings: political motive? I have no clue, but, does it matter? Political, religious, philosophical, personal --- it is all the same and boils down to hatred, ignorance, frustration and helplessness. Voting for me won't help. The human condition thrives."
"My lobbying against Johnny Depp, Who was picked   me in ""King of the Jungle"", worked. I refused to work with Depp. Replaced by Michael Keaton.  My hope was for Morgan Freeman (seriously). He refused. Seth Rogan also has a part."
"I'm not selling them. #CybersecuritySF is selling them. Seems a bit pricey to me. Plus any idiot going out alone at night looking like me is very likely to kidnapped, or whacked or worse."
Friday morning diversion.
Kim Jong Il visited ne in my dreams last night:
"A wedding video for my favorite niece. ""Don't expect fidelity"":"
Tequila and I taking a nap:
From @tommyp408:
My 2020 Campaign slogan:
Am I proud of the murder/conspiracy allegations leveled against me? No. But neither am I ashamed. Allegations are not acts. Anyone can make one. What matters is: can I calmly stand and face a world that's pointing fingers of accusation at me and stare back with equanimity? Yes!
"A Libertarian opponent from my 2016 POTUS run has stated that my multiple jail terms, allegations of murder, rape, drug manufacture, perverted sexuality etc, should disqualify me from the Libertarian platform in 2020. I'm confused. Have these qualities suddenly become bad things?"
I finally installed a coin operated telescope on our deck. Got to get my money back for the pitiful salaries I pay my live-in staff.
"Apparantly, I live in a homeowner's association. News to me. I put up a $30,000 fence for my dogs and the association wants me to take it down. My response:"
"So . . . . . as I said earlier - people sometimes compare me to the tech equivalent of Hunter Thompson. Depp is playing me in an upcoming movie, and to the right is a photo oh Hunter cutting Depp's hair on the set of Fear and Loathing. Coincidence, or . . . . . ?"
"For example: if you Google any subject - such as ""Democrat"", Google could choose to return all positive articles, all negative articles, examples of criminal/saint Democrats, etc. By appropriately choosing demographics, Google could rule the world."
"Google can select/choose what pieces of knowledge are disseminated - to social/cultural/religious groups, etc - down to individuals themselves. Such power allows Google to create multiple realities at will. Reality is merely our knowledge of the world as it is provided to us."
"I have frequently been called the Hunter S. Thompson of Technolgy. Not always in a flattering way. I admired Hunter and met him once, and I am a fan of his writing. The following words from Hunter define me with absolute perfection."
The two sides of myself:
"My Sommelier challenged me to drink a bottle of wine that Hilton Hotels sells for $700 per bottle  and compare it to ""Primal Sludge"" which we buy, in volume, for $1.63 per bottle. It was a no contest. After downing a bottle of each, Primal Sludge won, hands fucking down."
"Women --- while they do not know they are being observed. Rare, one of a kind footage. The last time women were observe in their natural state was in Atlantis - just prior to its disappearance beneath the ocean."
"A family member has gone AWOL. We love him. We are collecting him. En route, we stopped at Murphy's Bar in Virginia Beach. The hospitality was so enormous that we enlisted every patron at the bar, plus 3 bar employees, in our quest. You may monitor our progress, here, on Twitter."
My presidential run and its implication to our Crypto community:
This is he full complement of the 50 Docademic (MTC) hand made coins. No more will ever be made. You are looking at a fortune on this table. We will only give them out as prizes.
"Docademic in the news. In a few years, MTC will be the King of Crypto and the crypto field will be full of winners."
"After half a year of hard work, a limited supply of 50 hand made Docademic tokens have been made by @safexnelson. Team McAfee will be offering them as prizes for various contests, giveaways, etc. Being virtually priceless, they are not for sale."
"Why am I here? choosing sides. Standing up for those who despise me. Helping those who would not give me the time of day. Fighting Governments, power structures. Being jailed multiple times for my attempts to help the downtrodden. Who am I? Take a listen!"
And the light that I shine on Crypto will like no light ever before turned on and aimed at us.
"Had a media team at the house all day. Made friends with Justin Budd,   . He took the pick of me piloting our boat."
"Back, side or stomach, Duchess has to sleep with her head on me."
Duchess and I sleeping. This is how Duchess always sleeps - much to my chagrin.
Tequila. My Pit Bull friend and constant companions. She is alpha in the pack. Even our two Shephards won't fuck with her.
Mixology 101. Making a Gin Sky. Esoteric knowledge here folks:
"When I gain access to the National Stage (As I did in 2016), the World of Crypto will have a light shed on it than none before have been able to shine. The World will change. Freedom, at last, will be within our reach. Do we have the courage to grasp it?"
"Finally! Facebook engages in political censorship!  800 accounts banned, with 15 mil followers, based on the lie that they were Russian fronts. So fucking what? Are we so weak that we must close our ears to any and all voices that we find objectionable? Wake up! We are next!"
"Bedtime jockeying for position. @theemrsmcafee, of course, will be the final arbiter of who gets what real estate."
"Team McAfee Leadership (@McAfeeExecutive @officialmcafee @Loggiaonfire) plotting our World Domination Plan. You'll love it. We can think for you; choose, accept and reject for you. We can assume all of your adult responsibilities which are so obviously burdensome. You'll be safe."
".@JoeRogan to debate Roubini???  I like Joe, but he has zero murder allegations, no rape charges, no international spy allegations, he's not wanted by the law in a single country and he is six prison incarcerations shy of my record. (I have six). He is not quite in my league."
"My presidential run and its potential boon to the CryptoSphere is being talked about as far away as Qatar. The Blockchain and crypto will be the hottest topics beginning in 2019, I promise you."
"The ""Dalai Lama"" in the same sentence with ""John McAfee"". The End of Days is near:"
Marley looking for some sign of where this day may be headed.
"Hurricane Michael - beaten, weak and on its last legs, but still refusing to die, visited us on the Island two nights ago. We danced."
Newbies entering the Cryptosphere:
More on the Malta Blockchain summit. It will be a ground breaking event
Its weekend again. Weekend mixology coming up shortly.
More Twitter and Facebook banning of unpopular ideas. I merely want to know what shinking standard is being used to boot somebody..
"In reference to Kanye's password choices: ""Password"" and all zeros are the most secure passwords these days. Not even brute force decryption engines use them. The reasoning: no-one could be that stupid, so why waste processing power looking for them. Kanye is on the leading edge."
In truth: the crowd doesn't want the truth. It is why politicians lie. They cannot win by telling the truth. I dont want to win POTUS. I just want the stage. I will tell the truth.
Why I took over the Chairmanship of Appollo
Insights into Elon Musk. The article paints him as a badder version of me. I resent that. Sincerely.
The Winkelvoss Twins and Sophia will address the Malta Conference. I pray my headline speach is not sandwiched between them:

My Beards and Bitcouns interview:
The finest of Irish whiskeys:
One of my sweetest interviews from the Blockchain cruise:
The most extravagant Blockchain Conference yet.
"For those who keep asking me for financial help: I grew up poor in the poorest part of America - the Appalachias. I learned to expect nothing from this World, and therefore asked for nothing. You who are asking: get a job. Save your money. Do it yourself. You will thank me."
From Cocaine Chris: “You can’t get to old age by another man’s road. My vices protect me but they would assassinate you.” Mark Twain. . The truth. I am 73. I drink a gallon of whiskey a day. I take more drugs in a year than anyone could carry. I chain smoke. It works for me.
How to prepare for work. Mixology 201:
"My POTUS run can spark a free people. But our hearts must first be free. We can only create what we are. An angry people cannot create peace. A hateful people can build no loving structure. If we accept the Blockchain as our guiding light, our hearts and our minds can be free."
Kenn Bosak truly believes our future is crypto. His hearts right and hes so damn dedicated we interviewed on Thanksgiving... in Canada! (link:   @McAfeeAlliance
"Sorry . . . . Just have to do one more poll: Galileo made the first attempt to place an object into Earth orbit using fuel propulsion carrier vehicles. Of seven trials, none achieved escape velocity due to faulty gyroscopic systems. His max height attained was 93,000 feet."
"A powerful token for the distribution of renewable energy using their proprietary ""Smart Grid"" technology. Go check them out."
"Final poll: NASA's 1873 launch of an unmanned probe to Mars, headed by Col. Stauntan Andrews, exploded while still in the Earth's atmosohere because of a faulty capacitor in the orbital guidance system:"
LuxCore's anniversary:
"Poll 10: faulty Satellite communications caused Columbus to miss the coast of North America by nearly 2,000 miles, causing him to mistake the island of Hispaniola for the mainland."
"Poll 8: the siege catapult was long believed to have been invented by the Roman's. However, an archaeological dig in Zambia, headed by Jason Corwell, found an intact assault catapult, capable of destroying fortresses, that has been dated to the time of the Neanderthals."
"Poll 7: Benjamin Franklin discovered electricity in 1752. But no-one found an application for it until 1781, creating the first electric Gramophone."
Poll 6: Mankind first set foot on the moon in 1969. But the Morgan family funded a non manned flight in 1897:
Poll 5: The Sourh lost the Civil War as a direct result of Union Scientist's development of superior geolocation technology - allowing the Union to maximize supply line efficiency and troop movements.
There were no rechargeable batteries during the time of Cortez's conquest of Mexico. How then was he able to keep a reserve of battery power during the long March to Teotitlan?
Poll 3: Hitler's inability to gain access to Chinese routers was the main cause of the collapse of Germany's communications network.
Poll 2: terminating Germany's and Japan's access to the Internet led directly to their surrender during World War II
I will be running a series of polls over the next few weeks to help showcase the intellectual quality of the crypto community. First question: the American defeat in the Vietnam war was largely due to the superior quality of the  Vietnamese cell phone technology:

The SEC is going after Elon Musk because he chose a price of $420 (a marijuana reference) for privatising Tesla. So fucking what? Have we really come to this in America? Really?
"Dog treat time. Pound cake saturated with rum. Pit Bulls, especially, love it."
"Times are tough. Gotta take what we can. Got paid to shill ""Freakshow Wine"". Too cheap to pay me to include a website, phone number, handle, address or anything else of value in making them money.  Anyway, one freak show always recognizes another. Good shit. Drink more."
"Serendipity! Came out a few minutes ago. My ""Freedom"" rant followed up by my interview 9n the same topic:"
"People ask what my presidential policies will be. I have one: economic freedom, which invariably leads to personal freedom. If a people are not free, then policies will be made by their masters, and will mean nothing to the people. We must free ourselves first, then make policy."
"""John McAfee, 73, Very Stoned and Running For President""!   Well . . . . . . What more could you ask for?"
Swim day at the house.
My own breakfast this morning.
.@samdattola's breakfast this morning. Said he couldn't eat cause I was watching him.
"As with all great cultural transitions, true revolution starts at the bottom - with the poor, the disenfranchised, the marginalized. It is no surprise then, that in this Crypto Revolution, it is Africa that is first in making the dollar obsolete."
"My interview with Ethernews. All very accurate with the exception of the timing of our release of our Distributed Exchange. I said ""first quarter 2019"", not ""next month"". Other than that - not bad."

Our dedicated analyst @Team_McAfee are tracking every stolen token former accountant Luke Jenkins @paradigm2070 moves! @ethershiftco shut off his accounts and donated thousands of ClearPoll he dumped on their launch date. He moved 100k (MTC) on @aurora_dao IDEX exchange no more!
Unfortunately - true.

"God bless the folks if CoinShark! While wishing me happy birthday, they, with brutal honesty, shined a bright light down my throat and up my ass. I love you all."
So . .   .
"I think, incorrectly, that my followers connect with me. I saw Rick, with hip waders, wandeting in the bog this morning. He came in with dozens of leeches. Later, he made leech stew. Never had it before. Awesome! How many of my followers would follow? Vote next tweet."
"Those who say they don't know me - I am inconsistent, vague, obtuse and deceptive. Yes I am. I also have an unmasked reality which is me. Do you want to know who I am (most likely not)? For those one or two left, then watch this. Four times a year I unmask myself:"
"My good friend and compatriot @Loggiaonfire, has created the HOBOHOCOIN, @hobohocoin. Its claim to fame is giving you the HeebieJeebies (HBGB). It has no other value. However, my life is dedicated to giving my enemies the HeebieJeebies. I now have a simple, easy way of doing so."
"My wife, @theemrsmcafee, with a personal message to me on my birthday yesterday. This woman gave me a continued reason to live and someone to love - someone who knew the true value of love. Without her I am nothing, and the world is an empty place, and the darkness surrounds it."
"Running soda flavor tests in Frisco, Outer Banks. Insane results. Tomato, for example, goes well with most everything. On a 1 to 100 score, 80% of all combos scored above 90%, even peanut butter. Combinations with Key lime pie, caviar and miso soup, oddly, had negative scores."
"Would you forgive McAfee for deceiving you and still buy a six pack of Salmon flavored carbonated beverage, or brocolli flavored, or Dill Pickle, Wasabi, Pumpkin or other out of the box McAfee produced soda?"
"Yes, I deceived my followers. I apologize. The attached Jpg should explain. Please Express your pleasure/displeasure in my following post."
".@DickandMuddly brought me to my senses re: trout flavored soda referenced in my prior post. He reminded me about the clam juice frenzy some years back, which gave rise to Clamato, among other popular clam juice products. Compared to clam juice, trout soda seems positively yummy."
"Just received a white paper from a company I cannot name, which has produced a ""Trout Flavored"" carbonated soda. Clearly, sodas could use an out of the box flavor, but -- trout? Disregarding the question of why such a product might need a token, would you invest in this?"
I have been blocking my 100k+ trolls at 300 to 400 per day for two months. Conflict is coming. Distributed exchanges will free us from any possibility of control through regulation or legislation. Governments will be powerless. They will react. We have no more time for trolls.
A heartfelt thanks to CoinsBank
From my adorable wife:
"In Feb of this year, we began detailed audits of every company we advised or worked with. Of the more than 100 that we advised, less than 5 turned out to to be suspicious. We dropped support for these and we are revising our audit procedures. It is the wild west. @McAfeeAlliance"
"PS - my taking of the prior two photos, in immigration, was against the law. I freely admit to taking them and publishing them. The DOJ knows where I live. Come and get me."
"Our country - the USA - we must stand in line in immigration for two hours, making 90% of the arrivals miss their connecting flights, or pay our Government $100 and simply walk on through. I refuse to pay. Is this the Government of the people, for the people, by the people?"
"Decentralized exchanges, when fully functional, will mark the end of any potential control by governments and will be the beginning of the largest economic boom in human history."
"We hired master sommelier Seknam Ushuala from Tierra del Fuego to be Team McAfee's full time Sommelier. After months of travel and tasting, Seknam settled on our main Cabernet Sauvignon: Charles Shaw blend. Purchased in volume, we pay approximately $1.74 per bottle. Awesome."
".@Team_McAfee will be using the safest platform available for voting, crypto rating and selecting winners of the McAfee challenge! I'll be creating featured polls regularly so go to the link at   and download the Andriod or iOS App. Be ready to vote!"
"A few of the CoinsBank Team and some of Team McAfee at my birthday party. I am officially changing my birthday to September 14th. It's rumored, in any case, that I ate my mother, alive, from the inside out and gradually emerged, so a few days, in reality, make no difference."
My birthday present from CoinsBank!  I have never had a finer present. Proof that the Crypto Community is one if the most creative.
The gentleman on the last Blockchain cruise who challenged me to a drinking competition. Let ithet challengers beware. I was granted permission to use this photo under the condition that I not identify him or his company. The clever ones among you will figure it out.
"Rick Taylor, in charge of Team McAfee headquarters during Hurrican Florence. Here he is with two of our dogs in 100 mph winds. The house was shaking but Rick was unperturbed. Later he told me: ""This fuckin' storm doesn't have the balls to break windows and disturb me""."
"Daniel is riding out Hurricane Florence at Team McAfee's headquarters on North Carolina's Outer Banks, accompanied by two of our ex-military survivalist staff, and Rick Taylor - a man way too mean for any storm to fuck with. Daniel insisted on staying. ""Too much to do"" he said."
".@theemrsmcafee shot this during our sail around Ibiza. Stunning acrobatics. And, yes, my commentary might be described as ""colorful"". I offered him 2 Bitcoin for his shoes. He refused."

Gaudi's finest achievement. Carved out of solid granite with a teaspoon.
Gaudi's architecture and one of my guards provided by CoinsBank. For all of my women followers: I will sell his phone number to the highest bidder. DM me:)
"My support for BitFi is unwavering, in spite of the company's submission to their enemies. Their management is young and unfamiliar with the ways of business."
And I continue to support Bitcoin:
I'm keeping the pressure on HitBTC
"Gaudi. In my simple mind, the greatest architect of all time."
"Of the Blockchain conferences I have keynoted, the two @CoinsBank conferences have been the most successful and fruitful. They have spent more than a quarter of a million dollars entertaining myself and my team on this cruise, and I want to thank them from the bottom of my heart."
"Bless CoinsBank: They provided ten days of armored limos, helicopter convoys, private jets, VIP cruise suites, first class air for me, Janice and 6 of my team, military security, sailing excursions, in exchange for my lowly keynote. I feel I should wash their dishes for 20 years."
Boarding Evgeny's private jet. This day just keeps getting better and better.
This dude emerged from the deep with a message from Neptune: He's seriously pissed about the real estate prices in Ibiza.
"As with most of my interviews, I was wholly inebriated during this one. I just watched it and I learned a lot. I need to watch more of my interviews. I had no idea I knew anything."
"Jimmy was just told that we are being kidnapped by the Russians and that we will be forced to put up with this life forever. We are hoping for a rescue party to be organized next year, or the year after. There's no hurry."
Multiple sacrifices to the Sun God elicited this sunset response.

".@NetworksManager, interviewed me on the cruise. We touched on unspeakable topics. He took advantage of the fact that I was rolling on ecstasy and had just a dropped 200 mics of LSD. Here is his teaser:"
"Pawel, who is doing serious Crypto work, also designs his own glasses. Tell me the Crypto community is not ""out of the Box""."
"V.I.P. seating at the Futurama Blockchain Conference. Please ... Dis' me all you want for speaking at Russian, Chinese, Saudi, Australian and Singapore conferences, while simultaneously turning down Las Vegas invitations. They are at least demonstrating the potential of Crypto."
Pound cake with caviar. Russians - - - the fuckers know how to enjoy life. My kind of people.
"Arriving in Ibiza, our Russian Security, and Russian security meets US security."
Comung back to Ibiza by chopper. Certainly a dramatic island.

"Coinbene agrees to list, for free, any coin which is voluntarily de-listed from HitBTC. Any other exchanges willing to fight corruption?? If so . . . Join the McAfee Alliance."
Official announcement last night aboard the incredible CoinsBank cruise! @teammcafeenews @NewToTheStreet @newsbtc @McAfeeAlliance @Hitbtc Delist? Email: McAfee.Alliance2020@gmail.com
I held a press conference last night announcing the new alliance partnership between @coinbene exchange and  @McAfeeAlliance. In our fight against corruption @Team_McAfee will guarantee a free listing on @CoinBene to anyone willing to delist from @hitbtc effective immediately!
"Am at a brand new hotel owned by the Russian organizers of the Blockchain Cruise. We are in Spain but no-one here speaks Spanish. Surreal. Tomorrow we arrive back in Ibiza by helicopter for a grand entrance to speak at the next conference. My life is incomprehensible, even to me."
"My $100,000 bet at the tables last night:"
Early morning Pilates class:
"My lovely wife, @theemrsmcafee, giving a Blockchain presentation on deck Nine."
Yet one more example of the inability of local women to buy enough cloth to even cover themselves.
"A profile piece about myself that highlights most of my negative qualities. A good read. There has not been much negative press about ne recently, which concerns me greatly."
Horror of horrors!!!!! The Poverty of Ibiza is now slowly creeping throughout the cruise ship. We are considering notifying the Civil Defense authorities. This could be the global plague we have all been fearing.
"We are so fucked!!! We are here in Ibiza, mid trip, for the sole purpose of replenishing our supplies. We all voted to eat Jimmy alive since just moments ago he consumed the last of our stash."
"Team McAfee CEO, @McAfeeExecutive, is clearly moved by the abject poverty within Ibiza. Forced  by circumstance to charge $35 for a hamburger and $20 for a small can of Red Bull, these struggling people need all the support they can get."
The poverty in Ibiza is so extreme that waitresses must wear the most pitiful scraps of cloth. It brings tears to my eyes.
My heart goes out to the poor people of Ibiza. The poverty is so extreme here that they have to use hollowed out rocks as plates. I fully understand now why they are forced to charge $35 for a hamburger.
This needs no comment
"I saw Roman walking through the casino. I immediately asked: ""Friend .   . may I borrow your robe?"" He paused, shook my hand and replied: "" Not today my friend""."

"I am trying to understand the difference between the various wine glasses. It is all lost on me. I drink wine out of the bottle. I once downed a bottle of Cheval Blanc, 1947, St-Emilion, in seven gulps. I will never forget that moment."
We were invited to the Chef's Table. Five wine glasses per seat. Five forks (more forks than Bitcoin). Personalized menus with our names on them. I intend to piss on the table before we are through.
The summation of my talk tomorrow about how to distinguish Bangkok lady boys from legitimate female prostitutes. Those planning to attend can save yourself the trouble:
"Came to port at the French Riviera. Allegedly, I'm speaking tomorrow. My submitted topic was: ""How to distinguish Bangkok lady boys from legitimate female prostitutes"". Clearly, no one read it, because I'm actually scheduled to speak. What a surprise they will have."
"Apollo Currency is the first organization to Boycott HitBTC at cost of nearly half a million dollars. If awards for supporting ant-corruption in the crypto world were given, they would win top prize. Do I hear a ""next""?"

Me and @joergmolt waiting to board the boat for the European Blockchain Cruise:
We were met at the arrival gate in Barcelona and ushered into an armored Mercedes for our transfer to the cruise ship. I guess they  wanted no opportunity for me to be prowling the back alleys of Barcelona. It's good for a country to protect its citizens.
"Woke up to this Kung Fu/Beastiality/Comedy, with a twisted horror/love story ending. Not nearly as funny as “A Baby Once Eaten"", nor as erotic as “Platypus Poontang"", nor even as creative as “Kung Fu Hustle"", but it had its points."
"An entirely full flight; 3:00 in the morning, and only one person awake. Guess who, and doing what --- yes, @McAfeeExecutive, of course, and doing the only thing he ever does - working."

To the gentleman who claims to have Hacked the BitFi wallet: I say he is a publicity hound who is all talk. Here is my personal challenge. I promise he is too much of a coward to accept. He is only a wannabe hacker. He knows he cannot do it. Are you listening asshole?
"It's a no brainer. If Crypto has a Gold Standard, it is obviously Bitcoin."
"Want to be free? To be a thinkng individual? Then notice how rhe unthinking masses stick together, seemingly on the move yet, obviously, going nowhere. To live is to make your own decisions, asking no one's advice, and ignoring the loud bleating of the opinions of the crowd."

"I hired @Paradigm2070, after he was released from prison. He was still on parole. No one would hire him. I gave him what few would - a chance. I also arranged for his girlfriend, @gemcrypto, to come to the States for him. Big mistake. People are sometimes not what they seem."
"You think the future of crypto is disappearing? Dont be fooled. The certainty of Crypto's ultimate supremacy is plain. Just look closer, at the subtle movements within governments, banks and financial institutions. The ungluing of the existing heirrarchical system has begun."

".@exposemcafee alleged that Jimmy Watson was never a Navy Seal. Big mistake. Like every alegation made by that half wit Justin Sane, it was purely fabricated by these conspiritors to embezzlement in the hopes that there would be no evidence. The truth:"
"So .. @ExposingMcAfee: I've been slammed by the best (Netflix, etc). How can a ragtag group of malcontents produce a documentary, funded, I might add, by funds stolen from me, and composed of people I either fired or refused to hire. Good luck you fools. You sure need it now."
"This reply to a hater applies equally to all haters. Not that I want you to stop. Please God no! I need haters in order to continue success, because success is impossible without the hate of those who have none."
"CPollo lets investors do their homework on ICO's, audit their token contracts (we provide pre-audited templates), track the ICO's use of funds, freeze and retrieve some of their funds if there is a threat of being swindled by the ICO in question and much more. Very cool."
After a hard morning of leash training.
"My sidearm is with me 24/7. More: my sidearm  is ALWAYS in my hand when I'm on the toilet, sleeping and making love. Puts a kink in foreplay but some women love it. Accidental discharge? No. Some intentional when idiots tried to rush me. 2 women spontaneously orgasmed. Go figure."
"The most in-depth review of the BitFi wallet to date: Hopefully this and other legitimate reviews coming soon will put to bed the ""quasi-hackers"" claims that the   wallet has been hacked. A hack that does not get the money is an unsuccessful hack. Obviously."
A serenade to @theemrsmcafee. Just now. My own creation.
A McAFee song from @Cryptobal7040
ZCL is forking into @ANON_WeAreANON with a 2:1 ratio and MNs on Sept 10th. The ultra transparent team is led by @jbthecryptoking and he's at the Blockshow America's in Vegas right now! This will be the first transparent fork. #ANON #WeAreANON is our future.

My ode to the encounter coin:
"I am 72. I have .....  nothing to lose. What madman would goad ME in a state of nothing to lose? My mind is boggled at the number of haters standing in line to goad me. If an average, unknown person becomes invincible when they have nothing to lose, what do you think I become?"
"Churches: Attendance has declined for years. Imagine what a ""proof of Encounter"" coin could do for church attendance? See the beauty of this. If universally accepted, would this not obliterate ALL existing advertising channels. Think it through. Is this not the first real weapon?"
"Want to prove your a badass? Or the best fuck on the planet? Or your fearlessness knows no bounds? The blockchain will soon know - Through the magic of our ""Proof of Encounter"" mining system. You will know for a fact. And so will the whole world. No more bullshit people."
"Questions about the applicability of our Proof of Encounter coin? There are no limits: Adventure Travel, Prostitution, car sales, anything sales, shopping centers, carnivals, back alley poker games, ""I've been arrested"" societies, ""I Banged Suzie/Bruce"" societies . . EVERYTHING!!"
"We are are soon releasing the first ""Proof of Encounter"" coin: Did you get your sorry ass off the sofa and go to that Nissan dealer and test drive that red convertible you've been eyeing, and collect your ""Encounter Coins"" or not? Fucking simple as that."
"The most hated man in crypto poll (my post from yesterday) is not going well for Roger Ver. I must admit, here and now, he is a good friend of mine, along with Jihan Wu and Alex Jones. I've stood up stoicly for all three and will continue. You want a piece of them? Come thru me!"
"You will love this: one dude who stole the assets now claims he was never part of the Team, despite dozens of photos of him waking up at Team McAfee's headquarters, wearing his onesies and rabbit suits, workroom photos etc. If he never was here. Why are our tokens in his wallets?"
"Fir my numerous Portuguese language (Portugal, Brazil, Angola, Mozambique . . . ) followers:"
"Yes. I am undeterred. 7 months of every major power in the World, in a paroxysm of fear, attempting to crush, kill  eradicate, destroy Cryptocurrency. But it sprang from the most powerful Pandora's Box in human history. Nothing will force it back inside."
Profile of Team McAfee's new (2 months) CEO - Jummy Watson.
Know what you really want?
"Proclaimed myself, to my closest followers, tonight, in this place, in this storm - ""Tne most hated man in all of Crypto"". They laughed. ""Roger Ver"" they insisted. Fuckung ""BULLSHIT""! who is the most hated man in Crypto?"
"Para Cristoval. El es un Pendejo. Pero, el es tambien mi Amigo. Entonces.  . . . ."
"I’ve studied all security tokens. Few have survived, but far superior technology exists! We will never create ultimate anonymity with overpromised forks or mismanaged teams. I’m seriously excited about the ZCL fork to ANON on Sept 10th. @ANON_WeAreANON the new standard!"
Seriously. I don't fucking know.
"I turn down so many international offers of hospitality. I feel bad about it. Costa Rica, Mexico, the South Pacific, and almost half of the remaining world - the stomping grounds of my early years - are now forbidden to me for a variety of extraordinarily serious reasons. Sorry."
Well???
Don't we?? Be honest now.....
"My exact position when I punched the ""Tweet"" button for my previous tweet."
Fear of the fork: it mirrors Evolution. To the billions of existing species that have found their place in life. Can you not imagine the freedom of unlimited forking? To the point where individuals have unlimited freedom in choosing their crypto expressions - (powers/weapons/...)
"Absurdity of the week: one of the embezzlers claimed that I had misappropriated Team McAfee's funds.  Team McAfee is a DBA - me doing business as. Will someone with a legal background please tell this idiot that I cannot, at least in this universe,  misappropriated my own funds."
"Hey Dutchies - follow @LekkerCryptisch for daily crypto news, knowledge base articles, $BTC-updates, TA's, and FA's. They're working on adoption, and so can you!"

Everyone keeps asking me about Sether. Relax. I said in the beginning it was a long term investment. You are barely six months in. Here is a message from Serher's CEO:
"Have been documenting  all of the transfers to and from the two embezzlers' accounts. Seems like the conspiracy is widening. Storm clouds are coming for all involved. Yet again . .  a vivid reminder that trust and power do not, under any circumstances, mix:"
Janice unquestionably won the sunset photo contest this evening;
And here it is folks: The climax of the sunset:
Miss Janice enjoying a later version of that same sunset:
"Rob, lured by the promise of a magnificent sunset. We paused  our earlier discussion about doing a profile piece on Team McAfee's CEO - Jimmy Watson."
Good news for all holders of any ERC-20 token:
"If you are wondering if the   wallet has been hacked due to the recent media circus, here are login credentials for the 3 wallets we sent to Defcon. Anyone can log in and see the Bitcoin is still there! Extract the funds and we will pay $250,000!"
Waking up with two of our security guards.
"The BitFi hacking hoax: No one has taken the coins from our pre-loaded wallet. Do want you want. Access our servers if you like. Use social engineering on us, whatever - the hackers know it can't be done, so they create absurd scenarios and claim ""hacked""."
Las Vegas night club launches it's own cryptocurrency.
"The new ""Hot Tub Rules' for the house just arrived:"
Seems the embezzlers stole way more than $2 mil. Investigators have also absolutely determined that our accountant/investor had commingled his personal funds with the company's funds. Extremely illegal.
"Authorities making the case against the embezzlers are looking for an attitude of entitlement. They found this, about business expenses: ""Deals that I had no say in which I should have had"". This, from an accountant doing investments! The absurdity of this statement just hung him"
"Video of my most intimate dance with InterPol. One ot the embezzling conspirators is not a US Citizen. Thus InterPol. I tell you this: worse to mot comply with an InterPol ""request"", than to not comply with a Sinaloa Cartel ""request""."
"Embezzlers, in self delusion, explain their theft: ""It was my money! I controlled the account"". Some even believe ""it was my company"". Delusion does not save you from prison. 3 times in 26 years employees embezzled from me. Millions of dollars. This is the 4th time. Stay tuned."
"Laughing so hard I can barely catch my breath. ""Hackers"" play Doom, play videos, root the device, play music on the BitFi wallet. We dont charge extra for those facilities. No-one has taken the coins from our pre-loaded wallet. No one will. Isn't this what matters?"
I have accepted the position of CEO of LUXCORE. They have been working hard behind the scenes and will soon announce the availability of Blockchain features we have all been waiting for. I will still continue lead Team McAfee on its adventurous journey.
My parody gift to my followers on this Awesome Sunday night. Enjoy:
"A video played on your Bitfi wallet has nothing to do with the safety of your funds. This is amateur hour, not a hack! Any device with a computer and screen can be used to play games. I should start watching my YouTube videos on Bitfi wallet. Go to   !"
"Realized in the cold light of day that I had omitted a great deal of transgressions that many might consider notable. In the interest of completeness, here goes:"
"Haters periodically make ""Documentaries"" about my offenses against society. Allegations of drug use, irresponsible firing of weapons, sexual deviations etc. I like to put these documentaries to bed by confessing to these allegations up front. Saves time. Here are my confessions:"
"My predictions are shit only if they fail in 18 months - the minimum long term investment. Everything I recommend I buy myself. It made me one the richest men on earth. Ex: My $400,000 ride. My yacht, the largest on the Island. Success is truth. I invest in all my predictions."
"I get it people. I follow my own advice so I am as locked up as you are. For some of you, the difference is that, no matter what I recommend, I will hold for a minimum of 18 months. If you take any 18 month segment from Bitcoin prices, the minimum return is over 100%. Max: 2,400%"
A great synopsis of the Crypto'Adoption debate:
Without decentralized exchanges that mirror the power and functionality of centralized exchanges  we are lost. Governments can always shut down a centralized exchange. They cannot shut down a decentralized exchange.

"Excellent article on BitFi. It explains: ""Interestingly, despite several claims for hacks, none of the hackers has claimed to take away the bitcoins yet. Considering this aspect, one can believe BitFi’s claim to be unhackable."""
Decentralized exchanges are about to become a reality. I believe the first truly functional decentralized exchange will come from Luxcore.
"Are your coins secure on BitFi? Absolutely!! For weeks we have offered hackers the opportunity to get our wallet pre-loaded with Bitcoins. If they can take them we will pay them $250,000. No one has done that. It's a simple challenge. Your coins are safe."
"So I flew from the Outer Banks to Nashville, spent the night, and drove to Lexington, where I spoke to the Rotary Club. I agreed to do this before we moved to North Carolina, but a commitment is a commitment. Here I am."
"Do you all know what a ""conspiracy"" is? Example: It is legal to charge whatever you want for goods and services. However, if two or more companies get together and agree on pricing, then they have committed a major felony: conspiracy to fix prices. Same with banning Alex Jones."
"Jimmy, showing us the true face of the Easter Bunny."
"Has anyone considered the absurdity of most of our laws? This one for example: ""Employees must wash hands"". Who, exactly. Enforces this law? And how? I would love to hear the explaination."
"How is everyone missing this: if the three companies that banned Alex Jones acted together to coordinate his removal, then the legal definition of that act is called ""conspiring"". Have we all gone mad?? Such conspiracies result in many years in Federal prison. Please God! Wake up"
"Monday morning on the way to Lexington TN. Where, believe it or not, I agreed to speak to the Rotary Club about cryptocurrencies, which I agreed to months ago. I meet my commitments, irrespective of cost."
"Youtube, Facebook and Apple jointly shut down Alex Jones Today. I don't mirror Alex's beliefs, but he has the right to speak them. This video was not removed since I copied it to my channel. I dont side with him. But I will fight for him. For free speech!!"
The best news for cryptocurrency since the announcement that Thai prostitutes now accept Bitcoin.
"There are less than 4 million Bitcoins left to mine. What do you think the value of the last Bitcoin will be? Thousands of miners spending, in some cases, millions of dollars each to find it. Can the value be less than the effort? The value would have to be hundreds of millions."
The big Crypto Debate coming on August 9th. Don't miss it.
"Are American people setting the bar low? Or are real people starting to run for president? My own run, unl7ke my 2016 bid for the presidency, will be like nothing you have ever seen."

Monday morning in my neighborhood:
Sunday afternoon nap. Pitt Bulls look sweet when they're sleeping. Not so sweet when they're chewing off someone's leg.
Don't forget my live streamed debate with security specialists tonight at 7:00 Eastern. The debate is about the hackability of the BitFi wallet. It should be extreme.
"My interview with LearnCrypto about the future of the blockchain, the price of Bitcoin, the unhackability of the BitFi wallet and more."
"When I say there is no memory on BitFi, I am talking about storage of any piece of information regarding the identification of the wallet, the seed keys, or the pass phrase. Obviously there is RAM, because there is an operating system. But the RAM is devoid of all meaningful data"
How the Blockchaun can transform the world's Business structure:
How we have misapplied the Blickchain so far. We will eventually catch on. It's just a matter of time.
"Let's put this to bed. Using the wallet as a component in a video player is not a hack. Gaining root access on a device with no memory is not a hack. Intercepting a UPS truck , whacking the driver, modifying our hardware and delivering to the user? Please!"
"People trashing me about my July predictions. Please people, learn to read. I'm never wrong about long term issues. But read the caveats about near term predictions."
We are doing a live stream on YouTube tomorrow night at 7pm EST to have a round table discussion to address all the controversy and rumors about the Bitfi wallet. Please tune in.
"All wallets depend on paper back-up. This is a major security flaw, no different than stuffing money under your mattress. Like trying to keep a receipt but stakes are much higher if you lose it. With   all you need is your phrase stored in your brain."
Are we using the Blockchain intelligently?
"The press claiming the BitFi wallet has been hacked. Utter nonsense. The wallet is hacked when someone gets the coins. No-one got any coins. Gaining root access in an attempt to get the coins is not a hack. It's a failed attempt. All these alleged ""hacks"" did not get the coins."
Forgot the link to the no BS Crypto Telegram group:
Here's the link to the No BS Cryptp Telegram group. It's the most active of our groups and it's totally free. You will love it.
"The No BS Crypto group, which I co-founded six months ago, already numbers over 40,000 members. It is a free group. The ""paid"" section simply provides more advanced tools for analysis. The free section of no BS Crypto is still open and the current members are loving it."

"My privacy phone. I'm expecting as much flack from my haters about the phone as I've been getting about my BitFi wallet. Hating, however, does not change reality. No one can take money from the BitFi wallet. And my privacy phone is as private as it gets."
Hackers saying they have gained root access to the BitFi wallet. Well whoop-de-do! So what? Root acces to a device with no write or modify capability. That's as useless as a dentist license un a nuclear power plant. Can you get the money on the wallet? No. That's what matters.
My interview with @REKT_Podcast. A fairly no holds barred barrage of questions.

"We are increasing the bounty for hacking the   wallet to $250,000. The rules require you to empty the contents of a BitFi wallet that we have pre-loaded and have sent to you. You must pay for the wallet and its contents. Rules at"
“Very proud of my colleagues at Blackout Mobile and Team McAfee”. The world has officially become one step closer of having “The Luxury Of Privacy”. The Cloak Phone has officially arrived - Based on my original design for the ultimate private smart phone.
"A good article debunking ""reviewers"" of the BitFi Wallet who have never owned or even seen one. It's like reviewers of Bangkok prostitutes who have never had sex with one or even met one in person. How much weight would you give to that review?"
"Our cook @therealginaclay  sporting her new shoulder holster. Her hip holster kept getting grease splatters, flour, jam and other cooking ingredients all over it."
"We welcome Outing (OTG), the latest addition to my Bitfi wallet! There are hundreds of tokens out there, but do we know what they do? Outing has real-time functionality, anyone can relate. Think ""Waze"" of social entertainment and events. Prepare for the launch."
"Profile of my friend, Brock Pierce:"
"Rob Loggia's rebuttal to the fake ""reviews"" of BitFi. I say fake because none of the reviewers actually had acces to a BirFi wallet. Its impossible to say you reviewed something without actually seeing that thing. My haters are extreme."
"The rules for collecting the bounty for hacking rhe BitFi wallet can be found here:   . Before you waste your time, however, I have outlined why the wallet is unhackable. If you still think it is hackable after reading, then you need to reeducate yourself."
Be on the lookout for a big announcement at 10:00 AM EST on August 1st from No BS Crypto. You won't want to miss this!
"The challenge is not a ploy. Please God!!!  It is fucking unhackable  If you would only look into it instead of blindly accepting the status quo belief that nothing is unhackable, you might learn something. If you understood it, you would see how obviously unhackable it is."
"Everyone tells me   is hackable. Then register as a hacker and do it. We send you the device pre-loaded with $50 in BTC. If you get the BTC we send you $100,000. You will eventually give up. When you do we send you the pass phrase to recover your $50. Do it."
The pass phrase isn't stored on the   server.The server could be hacked (all servers are hackable) and the hacker could get the pass phrase that way. I'm not stupid enough to risk a ton of money on something that is hackable. The phrase is only in the mind.
"The $100,000 bounty to anyone who can hack the   wallet is not just for the first person who hacks it, but to everyone who can hack it. If 100 people hack it, each one gets $100,000. But I promise you, it cannot be hacked, ever, by anyone or anything. Try it"
"My interview with RT's evening news. I discuss my concerns's about our government's surveillance of us and suggest we abolish the current Government using Article 5 of the Constitution, and start over. A government that serves instead of controls."
Awesome review of my   unhackable wallet:
"I receive hundreds of DM’s about Bitfi. ""John come back to planet earth, where are the private keys stored in your alien device?” Good question. Nowhere in the universe except your brain.   is truly out of this world."
"It's not myself exactly. It's the corporate entity that will pay $100,000 to anyone who hacks my unhackable   wallet. Still . . . $100,000 is $100,000."
"ANTI-GUN FOLK: READ NO FURTHER. Now -- guns don't kill people. Bullets kill people. And if you want to kill people with a handgun, no bullet beats the FN-57. High velocity, flat trajectory, tumbles on impact, making massive exit wounds. I urge all all if my security to use it."
"Jimmy Watson, CEO of Team McAfee. This photo is the closest Jimmy ever gets to a smile. We've tried taking photos of his frown, but every device we've used become inoperable during the taking of the photograph."
Now people are asking “can’t someone just look over your shoulder and see what phrase you are typing”? No.The Bitfi wallet has a screen with an extremely narrow viewing angle and they won’t be able to see anything. Try it.
My first politically oriented tweet. Robert is a good friend of mine - a cross between Alex Jones and Phillip K. Dick.
"Bitcoin is now over $8,300. This is an average gain of $100 per day, every day, for the last 30 days. Tell me the bull market is not coming. It would be a lie."
Patio chairs after first storm. The green is a fungus. Reminds me of a 1950's SciFi movie about an alien fungus that turns people into plants. I've warned everyone about the danger. No one listens. Daniel has disappeared and a new bush suddenly appeared in the yard. I told 'em.
"Thinking I need more women bodyguards. They are more likely to shoot someone during their periodic angry states and they are anxious to get even with men for men's perceived dominance. Plus, they are a damn site more pretty than Jimmy and his crew. No offense Jimmy."
"For all you naysayers who claim that “nothing is unhackable” &amp; who don’t believe that my Bitfi wallet is truly the world’s first unhackable device, a $100,000 bounty goes to anyone who can hack it. Money talks, bullshit walks. Details on"

From my prior pist people asked for a guitar solo video. Dont have one. But here I am at the Portland Airport at 5:00 in the morning composing a tune for @theemrsmcafee on a piano outside a closed bar.
Two new dog beds for Tequila and Marley. They tore up theur previous beds. The guitar is my new Fender. A father's day present from Team McAfee.
"Please use your own judgement in Crypto issues. The press is notoriously biased for or against. Ex: recent articles point to a 20% rise in Bitcoin. On June 25 Bitcoin price was $5,775. Today it is over $8,200 - a 42% increase in one month. Do your own thinking. Trust no one."
Docademic featured as Coin of the Day on CoinPulse:
"Bitcoin over $8,000. I think the past week has shown that the bull market is right around the corner. A couple of months later than I thought, but in the long term, an insignificant delay."
"The $NOBS token is now added to the Coinex exchange. The world's most viral airdrop continues to impress ---&gt;   @noBScrypto is the only token to utilize the crypto community to self-regulate, rate &amp; review ANY crypto-related project to help eliminate scams."

wallet added to Bitcoin2140 wallet reviews:
"Everyone wants to know what happens if you lose your Bitfi wallet. All you do is get another one and type in the new device ID into the Dashboard. Nothing to restore, install or download. Your funds appear like nothing happened. Amazing shit!"
From @LynxCollection and @hodl_crypto
From my friend Erik:
"We created a simple, foolproof way to use the brain as the wallet. The   wallet is the transcriber between the inner brain and the outer world of digital currencies. Until someone discovers a means of hacking the brain, your money is safe."
Bezop and Docademic have been added to our   wallet. Both are up and coming coins and both will increase in value in the most secure wallet on the planet.
The Bull market is coming. Get ready for it.
"Once you get your Bitfi wallet you will never have to purchase, download or install anything again. No firmware to update, nothing to restore. How quickly can we spread the word that crypto is actually safer than storing money in a bank? Get one at"
I have thought about many ways to keep our cryptocurrency safe. The only solution is having nothing to store your crypto in. Attackers cant take what’s not there. This was not possible before   Now you can store $100M in your brain and no one can touch it.
"Unlike all other storage devices, Bitfi has a powerful CPU that calculates private keys from your special phrase. Ive been fascinated with cyber security since computers looked like houses!   is unhackable IF you follow the simple setup instructions."
My goal is to accelerate the adoption of Bitfi wallet. Doing so eliminates archaic institutions and replaces the need for untrustworthy exchanges like Hitbtc. The world will not accept cryptocurrency until we can access and safely store our funds.
I see few hard results from whatever help there is.

The Good Fight:
My Vogue subscription arrived today.
Bitcoin manipulation: the co-coordinated conspiracy was to attempt to crash BTC. It has not worked. It will not work. The rubber band is about to snap back.
"Great article in Docademic today. It is clearly the next ""thing"" in crypto:"
I'm amazed at how astonishingly stupid people can be. I talked about Docademic a day ago when it was $0.15. It rises to $0.23 on TopBTC yesterday and whales start to cash in. You are the people who would have sold BTC for $0.10 in 2013. Docademic will be $10.00 by end of year.
"It requires imagination: a world where everyone has the red button app - “I have nothing left. I'm jumping"". A caring face with kind eyes appears. “step off the bridge son. Let's talk.”   .  July 23rd. It is coming. Docademic’s (MTC) new app. Moving to the very soul of crypto."

"The main stream media - controlled by the existing power structure - reports that price manipulation was involved in Bitcoin's price rise last year. Manipulation did happen, but it was a conspiricy to push the price of Bitcoin to the absurd low level that you see today. Wise up!"

How my run for POTUS can help us all:
"I have no intention of winning the election for US President - a dull goal. My intention is to disrupt the entire election process by shining a spotlight on the corruption, fraud, collusion and abuse of power by the elite who control our elections. 'Tis nough, 'twill do."

You ask why I need security. I tweeted islamming the SEC yesterday. Last year I debated the FBI on CNN and trashed them. I posted the video earlier. Here I trash the NSA. There is no US agency I haven't trashed. Any questions?

Even the Financial times is no reporting positive signs for Bitcoin:
I'm not alone in being bullish on Bitcoin. The major influencers in the crypto world agree with me:
Docademic is down to $0.15. (On May 12 it was $0.02). Highest performing coin in the bear market we are in. When the market turns this will be the winner.
"EOS launch: ignore any immediate price fluctuations due to the investigations of Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Kraken. Any dop will be short lived and followed by a boom."
My disdain for the Chairman of the SEC:
"Do not panic about the drop in Bitcoin's price. It is an overreaction to the news that Bitstamp, Coinbase, itBit and Kraken are being investigated for price manipulation. This will delay the bull market by no more than 30 days. Don't buy into the fear. Buy the coins."
More on the SEC:
Currency independence and my 2020 bid for the Presidency:
Few of you are voting (a few thousand so far). Yet the meme war has been one of Crypto's defining moments. Too indifferent to show the world who we are? Or maybe you missed the link:   Get out there and make your mark. Vote. Or else.
"If any of you doubt my ability to debate on CNN, please see this CNN debate in which I rip the FBI a new.....  John McAfee and the FBI Finally Face Off On CNN (CNN Interview)   via @YouTube"

"Me, just now, pondering answers to your meme war comments."
"Everyone is complaining. ""Don't like the voting procedure"". ""My meme was not selected"". ""Its not fair"". You want perfection? Find a different universe. Myself and my team submitted nothing. I'm spending nearly $20,000 in prizes plus built a separate website. I demand some slack."
"MEME VOTING! I will now give 1 Bitcoin to the winner of the jpeg entries and 1 Bitcoin to the winner of the animated entries. The 3 runner ups will receive 2 Ethers each. Vote at: .   . You may vote as many times as you like, but only your last 3 votes count"
"Governments rely on our 'exit' into Fiat currencies to find out what we have done. What if our world had no 'exit' into Fiat. For myself - everything, and I mean everything, is purchased with crypto. From houses to cars to food and clothes. If I can do it. So can you. No exit!!"
"Cryptocurrency will become a $20 trillion market. I believe it will be 10 times that. Remember: Fiat currencies will be drastically devalued as Crypto advances. By 2021, the US dollar will be worth only 1/5 of what it is worth today. Believe these numbers"

Please recommend additional languages into which The Declaration Of Currency Independence should be urgently translated. We picked our fourteen translations on a best guess basis. This document needs to signed by crypto proponents of all nations.
More articles slamming the entire crypto world - some of them asking that the DOJ shut down crypto in its entirety. After our release today of The Declaration of Currency Independece -   - this will be politically difficult.
"To read the actual Declaration of Currency Independence, for those who apparently missed it in the signing, it is here, translated into 14 languages:"

is in presale! An exceptional concept designed to modernize e-commerce through a marketplace accepting cryptocurrency. The affiliate program pays users in tokens for promoting products. The tokens can then be used to make other purchases. Brilliant!
"So odd. No one knew the date nor place of the Korean summit until today. I predicted both the date and place two days ago. People are trashing me because Trump's letter, revealing both the location and date, implies it won't happen now. Do I get no credit at all?🙄"
"First public statement, from Donald Trump himself, about my June 12, Sungapre prediction made 2 days ago. Oddly, my algorithms are still predicting the meeting, with a possible change of venue to Japan. Go figure:"
"My short term price predictions: in a major dip, with nearly everything dropping, the price of Docademic doubled since my prediction. The market will turn before June 12th and my predictions will hit. My algorithms predicted Trump's June 12th date. They have never been wrong."
"With over 21,000 votes in, my followers, by a 40 point margin, would like to have a privacy movement within the crypto field. I will start with a currency independence site, with a plan of action. It will be up in a few days. Signable on the blockchain if you agree with the plan."

"I love the crypto business. This morning, based on numerous media reports, I apologized for recommending Cryptosecure. I was trashed for recommending garbage. This afternoon, I apologized to Cryptosecure for jumping the gun. I was then trashed for spreading fud. Go figure."

"We dosed Eric, our chef, with a massive dose of psilocybin and sent him shopping for groceries.  His ""minder"" is on Smack. Doubt that we will see either for the rest of the day."
"Many of you want regulations for crypto. Please see this: regulations protect those who cannot protect themselves: the weak. Yet all of us must submit to it. We are no longer free. Governments are designed to serve, and outside of national defense, they are poor protective agents"

"While our pursuers are chasing our smartphones, carried by poor look-alikes, across 2 states, we've been busy. To add to the entertainment, Mr. McAfee will no longer charge $1000,000 for a tweet. It's free. Send any tweet to TheMcAfeeboys@gmail.com. we'll randomly pick 5 per day."

"Mr. McAfee was served with his first SEC subpoena on 9/20/2016, after speaking out against SEC abuses and claiming that the SEC itself poses the greatest danger to the very investors it was designed to protect. He gives an example from his own experience:"
. Mr. McAfee's first video message from his armored motorcade:
"I am underground. This story by Rob Loggia explains all. I am the most vocal and angry opponent of the SEC. They are striking back with subpoenas. If I am silenced, it is the movement that suffers. I cannot allow this. My team will be my voice. Stay safe."
Just watched a campaign video from my 2016 presidential run. Every word and image in it applied better to the cryptoverse than to the political party that I represented. It was clearly a premonition - an anticipation of the power of our movement:
"In the ""sad but true"" department: Few have more ICO experience than Team McAfee, so I feel obligated to report the sad truth that this diagram, in many cases, would be a welcome improvement over the actual results."
"Banks must transform into crypto-supportive entities or else die. Evrofinance Mosnarbank, in Russia of all places, is proving that if only one bank adapts, the resultant power defies even the U.S. Government and the worst it can muster:"
"Team McAfee's Director of Moral and Religious Enforcement - @TheJoshBuchanan - has only one talent - righteousness. As such, common characteristics, like smiling and artistic appreciation are missing. Fortunately, his lovely lady @theamandanation balances him well. Her artwork:"
"We have finally dislodged institutional investors from their ""Watch but don't touch"" seats at the crypto table.  We can now watch and, most likely, dance as our favorite coins accelerate to their true values in a world that values the long term."
"To my wonderful wife @theemrsmcafee - you are the mother of mothers. Through our darkest times, I kept close the images of you with our children. Michaelangelo would have achieved ultimate bliss to have had you as the model in his Pieta."
"You trash my abstractions - ""Blockchain will change the world"". ""Crypto is the Magic Wand"". ""Nonsense"" you say. So here, as concrete an example as you will ever get: Jimmy Watson, Navy Seal, Executive Director -Team McAfee, 6 months before (left) and 6 months after the Blockchain"
Our newest Team McAfee programmer - @FluentNinjitsu
The power of the blockchain is greater than our imagination. It is up to us to wield this power responsibly:

. The blockchain = No More Bosses
"The SEC made us fear Ethereum because Bitcoin was so obviously just a currency and out of their realm. They want to crush crypto, so the only way to scare us is to frown at Ethereum. The legal field is clear: Fish will ride bicycles before Etheteum could be called a security."
"Intel suggests that bad guys are coming. Jimmy has to sign his neice's birthday card so will be MIA, but 18 additional security arrive today - all with class III FFA licenses. The fireworks should be intense if the dark crowd shows. Full story coming from Rob Loggia on the 18th."
"Jimmy asked about my life on the run after Belize. ""Too much data to even begin to process"" I replied. Then I remembered the intrepid reporter from the Financial Times that promised to go with and in panic dropped out. He wrote the best story though."
"COIN OF THE WEEK: Over 7,000 of my followers emailed us within the past 5 days and submitted their recommendations for the Coin of the week. The winner, receiving 511 votes, was NCASH. Not a bad out come I think."
Another example if the enormous gains that have happened in the crypto world.
I tell JP Morgan the truth. And make Jamie Dimon an offer that no man with an IQ above 12 could refuse. From a video that will be shown at the World Blockchain Conference in Atlantic City on July 12 of this year. I will be keynoting.
"The $NOBS token airdrop distribution will be on 05/09. If you haven't claimed your 10K free tokens yet, do so here: 5/9 is the deadline. Your data will not be disrespected or sold. And for those filling out multiple forms, our system flags those. Nice try"
". @Docademic MTC token is now listed on HitBTC, Sistemkoin, Idex and   Docademic users will be rewarded MTC tokens that will enable growth and increase the value of MTC. Free basic healthcare service without discrimination."
". When any of us make a gain we all make a gain. We are a family, not strangers enjoying time at a bar for a few hours. One more example of an individual gain that benefits crypto as a whole:"
"Many believe that Bitcoin will reach $150,000 before the end of this year."
"Yes, I did win the 2004 Hawaii Whale Fucking contest. However, Mr. Loggia's suggestion that this too is an area of life where my advice would be valuable is false. I have not yet resolved the conflict of my still active infection of Whale Clap and my unending love for the whale."
Finally . . . . . A decently written article that doesn't imply that I should be deported to Pluto and my entire progeny tracked down and eradicated so that my genes do not poison the entire human species. The author actually said one or two nice things.
"Three months ago my followers, fairly unanimously, demanded total honesty of me. I gave it. The sharp observers among you realized that you had already been getting it, continued to get it, and are getting it now. I promise you will always get it, and you mostly will not like it."
Coin of the week new twist: my followers will choose the coin. Email weekonecoin@gmail.com. include your recommended coin in subject line. Multiple emails from sock puppets or yourself will result in you being blocked. Will announce the most recommended coin Sunday at 2:00 CST.
Met Quinn at the Blockchain Nation Conference last week in Miami. He was on the run from the law so we gave him sanctuary at Team McAfee's Cathedral in Tennessee. Bastard never paid me.
My business partner - Chris Koerner's @noBScrypto bank emptied his accounts for being a Crypto enthusiast. Sounds fair.

"In the Bitcoin frenzy, let's not forget Ethereum . . . ."
"Is @hodl_crypto deluded, or does he perceive a truth that only the calm and collected can see? I am biased, so that must be taken into account, but I perceive myself as one of those few believers who are fully committed, irrespective of cost, to the crypto movement."
"82% of investors believe that a major crypto Bull Market is underway. I'm not the sort of person who would ever say ""I told you so""  but . . . . I fucking told you so."
"A big update was made to the @noBScrypto algorithmic spreadsheet today:     In addition to updated rankings, 3 columns were added to the far right of each tab that identified metric combinations that have shown particularly outstanding correlation."
"On the ""Post Secret"" website, I read - ""I have masturbated while reading the Bible"". I feel far less isolated now.  Have a joyous weekend my friends."
Bitcoin Pirate's hint #1
. @ThaiStarkovich photographing my favorite son @McAfeeExecutive - the only photograph existing in which Jimmy is smiling:
The Beacon Hitel in Miami. I Checked into this hotel the first night after my release from my Guatemalan imprisonment. I met my wife @theemrsmcafee here that first night and have spent every night with her in the intervening five and one half years.
Crypto Market could reach 40 trillion:
. @TheJoshBuchanan celebrating his birthday with Team McAfee in Miami. Only @McAfeeExecutive (with unbelieving expression) knew it was not really Josh's birthday.
At the Blockchain Nation VIP dinner last night someone caught @theemrsmcafee and I cutting loose.
"""Please sir . . . . believe me!!! Everyone with an iPhone voted for you!  Just let my social engineering team leader join us!"""
Our good friends from La Cosa Nostra: Joey @SrDirenzo and Denise
"More pressure on Jamie Dimon to accept reality, come to the table and accept surrender terms. We are asking for universal disarmament from the banking/government Axis."
"One quarter of Team McAfee arriving in Miami. Our advance guard, headed up by ex Navy Seal Jimmy Watson and Ex Green Beret Josh Buchanan, cleared the field of opponents. I am now free to say whatever I fucking want when I keynote the conference."
Part of Team McAfee arriving for the Blockchain Nation Conference. Jimmy and Josh arrived yesterday to silence opposition. You might be able to squeeze in. Call Quirtman at 612 382 5552 to get your last minute tickets. I was paid nothing for this tweet. Not even a fucking blowjob
My response to a close friend threatening to write an expose of my new NOBS coin.
"On my way to keynote the Miami Blockchain Conference, I happened to run into the TSA.  ""Take of your shoes"" he said.  ""I'm 72. How old do I have to be before I dont have to?"" I asked.  ""75"" he said  I said. ""Convenient. Just when I'm too fucking old to travel"""
"There are few seminal events in the past 300 years: the Industrial revolution. The automobile, airplane, and the Internet. Each changed the world in a predicted way. Crypto is one. Banks will be gone in 5 years. Governments must seek new revenue sources. Please, God, accept this."
For those of you grooving on the prior tweet. This is not my first go around with Jamie. We met on CNBC after he called Bitcoin a fraud:
"To Jamie Dimon:  As the brains of the Banking/Government plot to end crypto, you lied. You took our credit cards and bank accounts. You made governments shut down exchanges and restrict us. You hurt us. But clearly we live. We cannot be stopped. Ready to talk terms of surrender?."
Since February I've been posting links to my @noBScrypto algorithmic spreadsheet &amp; communities. Nothing is pumped &amp; everything is open to scrutiny. Our community has improved it over time. Adherents even won in the bear market: Here's the sheet:
Bull Run Imminent!
"This is how my wife @theemrsmcafee says it's OK for me to say the ""N"" word to a black man. Taking applications now:"
"AMA with CEO of Safex. When asked whether he paid me to recommend Safex he truthfully replied no. I consistently report that I have never been paid to recommend a coin. Who would pay me? It's stupid. For ICOs and everything else, of course I get paid. Lots"
"Luke @bixlawl bought a Samurai sword to commit Harikari with if his crypto projections didn't come true. I had to gift him my 16th century Samurai helmet because I cannot tolerate informal suicides on my property. Now, formality is assured in the unlikely event he was wrong."
"Panthers Capital CEO: ""This is a very good time to buy Bitcoin"""
"Fashion night at team McAfee. Luke, sporting his latest nouveau-smack combo - Jaques Fath slippers, Vicente Bellini shorts and a one-off Akira Kagemusha quasi-robe, was the uncontested winner."
Bull market coming. Hang on to your chair:
"OK. This is my last day of frivolous tweets for a while. It's Friday. The market is recovering. We have our ducks lined up. We hit the ground running on Monday. And, I want to see future NO PANICK SELLING! Clear?  It's now the weekend. Time to rob old ladies and kidnap children ."
"This is how out of the loop I am. Luke @bixlawl is one of my team, lives with me, and I see him dozens of times a day. I just now found out he is selling Bitcoin high tops. Maybe I need to change my policy of demanding all income be turned over to me plus 10% for my trouble."
"I believe the poll in my previous tweet proves, once and for all, that my trolls are in the minority. Now, for you trolls:  ... move on, or climb aboard the only express train in the cryptosphere. Your choice."
"With almost 2,000 votes I stopped the poll to give us a rest. The number of votes is statistically valid. Clearly, more than 70% of my followers don't want me to stop doing what I'm doing. For those in the minority, climb on board or sit on the sidelines."

I will do weekly tweets of the top ten predictions (see prior post) from my NoBSCrypto groups.  Our predictive algorithms are based on data scraped from social media and blogging sites by our bots. These are long term investments. I will post 10 so no pump n dumps are possible.
Monday I post the performance of the top ten coins predicted by my NoBSCrypto groups from 60 days prior. Not for day traders. LT investors -  picks will still be good buys.  Telegram -   Facebook -   Discord -
The market may have turned. It's time again for me to keep you informed of those efforts in the cryptosphere that I deem worthy of working with. . . . Or . .Time to start shilling worthless shitcoins. . Depending on whether you truly follow me or just troll me. Let's get to work.
Team McAfee on their night off.
"We paid with Bitcoin at the Old Hickory Steakhouse in Jackson, TN. Bottom right is Satoshi with his autograph, requested by the restaurant manager - top right."
Satoshi with his solid gold Bitcoin
"Jimmy Watson, myself and Satoshi Nakamoto at the Hop a Long Steakhouse in Kyoto, Japan."
"I am advising the LuxCore development team (be nice). They are a solid group of developers and I agree with their vision, as I do with other development teams/coins.  You can either mindlessly trash my picks, or you can learn something. Try the latter."
"People ssk how I beat Jimmy unconscious, and shoved a harmonica up his ass. Picture this: A naked 72 year old man (a horrifying sight) bursting out if his bedroom with a rear leaf spring from a 1948 Packard. I could have wasted my entire security while they were paralyzed."
"Janice and I in Toronto. Canada is the only country in the world that does not have a subpoena or process server out looking for me. To rectify that, Janice and I robbed this street musician shortly after this pic was taken."
"How quickly the world forgets the talents of the elderly. Just today I received a dubious ""congratulations"" from someone who noticed that I beat Jimmy for interrupting a particularly satisfying fivesome. Did he not even know that eightsomes were my norm fir 5 years?"
"I've had DMs from Jimmy @McAfeeExecutive supporters disrespecting me because I kicked Jimmy's ass in a manner that was ""beyond reason"". But I asked ""NOT TO BE DISTURBED"", and that prick pulled out a fucking harmonica. In my defense, I am 72 and here is Jimmy prior to the beating:"
And for those who doubt that I did in fact kick Jimmy's @McAfeeExecutive ass while stoned and tripping. And while having sex with my wife and three other women. And while cooking a gourmet dinner for two State Senators. And while sleeping.
Yikes!!!! I overlooked the infographics for the No BS Crypto airdrop   . Here it is:
"The Coin Brothers latest video: ""Panic Selling"". (I'm in it):"
Seldom does anything grab my attention. But ......... Wow. ....... Just wow.
"You may remember Viktor Wang @TheReal_Wolf_  from this past weekend. He was the real ""Wolf of Wallstreet"" and actually played a bit part in the movie about himself. Now out of prison he works closely with Team McAfee. Brand new to Twitter, I helped him get some followers:)"
Jimmy @McAfeeExecutive preparing to eat a raw dog as a result of a poorly chosen bet.
"The No BS Crypto community is having a 10,000 token airdrop:   No ICO or token sale - 100% airdrop. 3k free $NOBS tokens to anyone &amp; 7k more for simply joining the free No BS Crypto communities  Ever see a token structure that generous? No BS. RT for thanks"
My wife @theemrsmcafee has been wanting me to tweet this photo for many months. She just scraped the money together to pay for the tweet.  It's a lot of money for her. Go visit her.
"Weekly Jimmy Watson quote, overhead by Janice while Jimmy was questioning an intruder: ""Excessive denials always lead to moderate admissions""."
"Bitcoin at $20,000 by years end? I believe that's absurdly low."
Winner of the Hunan Stain Superhero Costume Contest - @kennbmondo
"My external security system. On top of this I have 8 cameras that no-one knows about. I have 4 Green Berets, one Navy Seal, 2 ex Blackwater SOF operatives, one ex Army Military Police  and two.ex Army soldiers as my live in Security. Plus Janice and I, heavily armed. Questions?"
"Netflix is now showing ""Gringo"". Before you think you know something about me consider: Everyone interviewed in this documentary recanted their statements. They were all paid. See below or on my YouTube channel. Yo will get to see the underbelly of the MSM"
"To those wanting a piece of me: I own nothing - no property, no securities, co cryptocurrency, no cash. The watches that I wear are on loan from my many friends and I have documentation of the loan. So are the cars I drive, and every Item that I use costing more than $1,000."
Zeeshan Najeeb has joined Team McAfee as director of Mideast Enforcement. Sean McAllister resigned the post last month. Please welcome Zeeshan:  @ZeeshanNajeeb
"My wife, as usual, was sent all the good Human Stain Superhero costume entries. Smart people know that reaching me through my wife, has infinitely more power than reaching me directly. Ah .... those who understand the intricacies of marriage are those closest to ruling the world"
"The following Human Stain Superhero Costume Contest entry, with video, points out the many pitfalls that crop up when entering contests while tripping on acid."
"P.S. @theemrsmcafee has asked me many times to promote her Twitter account. As you all know, however, I dont do Jack Shit for free, and she never coughed up the money. Otherwise, I would have recommended that you follow her simply because she is one fun bitch."
"My lovely wife @theemrsmcafee chastised me for the following reply to someone else who was chastising me (Metachastisement). I do not mean to insult people, but if you are standing in my way and politeness is insufficient to move you, then I will use whatever means are available."
".@TheReal_Wolf_  is a good friend. He asked how much to promote his new Twitter account.   BUSINESS RULES: 1. Everybody pays 2. Never cut your price  He had $30,000 cash (never checks from friends). $85,000 short.  I took the cash plus contract: he sends naked photos of his wife"
".@TheJoshBuchanan correctly identified @TheReal_Wolf_ behind me in my prior post.  He's the real Wolf of Wall Street and played a bit part in the movie. Now, out of prison, he hangs here with my other ex-felon friends. He's the most serious of us. He's new to Twitter. Follow him."
"Twitter has fubar'd my name yet again. A fake, verified by Twitter, John McAfee account. I can only infer that APCNigeria purchased a verified account and changed it's name and identity to me. What idiot programmers Twitter would not check for this obvious loophole."
"The Force is with us. Again. In the next dip, everyone will be panicking when Bitcoin drops to $25,000."
Saturday night. The hat showed in the mail.
"Do you believe that the Blockchain will change the world? If so, will it be better or worse?   Change is coming, and the nature of it depends on you, here, right now. Will your contribution be the petty squabbles and judgements? Or will you act on your beliefs? Only 2 choices"
"The ""experts"" who doubt my 12/2020 Bitcoin price prediction forget that as crypto grows, huge devaluations of Fiat will occur. No one who understands crypto doubts that the U.S. dollar will have zero value in 10 years. Why then not accept a 500% devaluation in 2 and a half years?"
Slowly. But Surely. The cryptoworld wizards are beginning to catch up with my Bitcoin price predictions. I stand fully by my certainty that there will be no dick eating on Dec 31st. 2020.
"Possibilities are endless when Free Health Care is a reality. Docademic ICO ends on Sunday, not without monumental success! One of the best ICOs I've seen. Deals in the US, China and Latin America.  I hope everyone seriously looked at this ICO."
"Among the top 20 picks from the McAfee ""Human Stain Costume Contest"" are these:"
"While not exactly a costume, this entry that I just received for the Human Stain Costume Contest, was one of the most eye catching:"
"We take measures to ensure that the top 20 @nobscrypto algorithmic picks are never pumped. Ranking updates are quietly made at random, unannounced times. Not once has a ranking update ever been tied to a pump. Serious long term investors only. Join us."
An objective view........
"So far, this is the best entry yet. Yes, obviously, very little time and energy was expended on it. But ..... it is the costume that i wore uncountable times in my youth, and I feel very comfortable wearing it. This is the new bar folks"
"Few have seen the Human Stain naked, but those who have are forever changed:"
"While not exactly the superhero costume design that I asked for, it does ooze creativity and prior knowledge from every pore. But, unfortunately, the one Ether prize will likely not be yours."
"Discovered by a Jesuit priest in a St. Louis coffee shop. Proof that, as I revealed in the previous tweet, I am really ""The Human Stain"" (HS)"" - the superhero you all know and love."
"In 1990, Gordon Eubanks, CEO of Symantec, wrote to Peter Norton: ""John McAfee is a stain on the fabric of Global business"". I am now revealing my secret superhero identity. I am the ""Human Stain"". Yes. Really. Best HS costume submission gets 1 Ether.  mcafeenomad@gmail.com"
"Angela' tweet: Seeing it, I tried to recall why I refused to follow one of employees - her.  Frankly, I could not remember. But it must have been serious.   Meanwhile:  She, reading over my shoulder, ran and grabbed the whiskey and poured me a glass: thanks Angie  .  Where was I?"

"First time I've quoted my own tweet, but here goes - Wake up just enough to perceive this obvious truism: as crypto moves in, Fiat is devalued. As Fiat is devalued, inflation sets in. Not one person has talked about this yet. Strange don't you think?"

Interested to know how the cryptoverse is distributed throughout the world. Let's start at the top level. What region of our planet are you located in?

"They say I sold out 'cause I use my tweets to promote, but the last 200 ICOs that lined up, we rejected 195 and chose 5. I only promote what I believe. In addition, all ICOs that we promote, since Finacoin, are audited by Crypto Connection. And I limit promos to 2 a day max. So.."

"Here's what I find funny: Ethereum is trashed more than any currency, and yet no currency is more necessary and central due to It's smart contract platform that is used by more than 50% of all new altcoins. It's like everyone values water, but not the containers it is carried in."

Another decent article about    CryptoSecure Platform Promises Hackproof Crypto Transactions via “SafeWindow”

"As I and others predicted: China now accepts the inevitability of cryptocurrencies, and even the likely disappearance of fiat currencies. It's the Chinese way: make a new thing illegal until it is understood, then accept it. We will soon be in fat city."
"The most irrational dip is Ethereum. Which of us engaged in the day to day payments and receipts in the crypto world do not favor Eethereum? We all know it is the only truly functional platform .... yet, please God, look at the price! This is an opportunity if I ever saw one."
Ok. Enough! Did we learn nothing from the last scare the banks and world governments threw at us? Use your heads! The SEC has no power outside the U S. and it's population of less than 10% of the world. We are distributed. The SEC's power is restricted to threats and gestures.
We drank all of the alcohol in the hotel. I personally made a pact with the devil for as much of the Devil's juice as we could consume. There is a reason that Absinthe is illegal in every country except Thailand and North Korea.

Cryptovest's take on the SEC move against us:

Congratulations Travis Robinson! You are the winner of the McAfee Effect Challenge. Remember to send your BTC address to info@eristica.com for verification.
The   ICO tokens are now on sale. My advice is to check it out.
Sunday morning for the pups:
"Lots of DMs about the   ICO. No, it's not just a clone of Twitter. It is the first decentralized fully autonomous social network. It is open source.  After it is fully developed it will be given to the community to be governed. Check it out - an obvious buy!"
"To clear up a question: Yes the   ICO page contains a link to their real beta. It is not a simulation. It is a blockchain based Twitter clone that is working now. If you didn't invest because you thought it was a bunch of screenshots, then go back and see."
Team McAfee Sunday morning snapshots:
A visualization of what will soon happen in the old world of banking and finance as Cryptocurrencies begin to dominate:
"Thr HIVEWAY ICO (  is now live! This Blockchain based, distributed version of Twitter is what many investors have been waiting for. The beta is fully functional and their system is ready to go. Buy early!"
Saturday Night at the McAfee Team headquarters:
"The Crypto Secure ICO (  overcomes the largest threat facing the cryptoverse - stolen coins. CryptoSecure’s SafeWindow will make you, your IP address and your geolocation invisible to everyone. Your cryptocurrency and privacy is secured."
"Some have questioned the Enquirer's story of giant grasshoppers eating small children. It's absolutely true. That's the story I gave to the police when they questioned me about the disappearance of all those children. Fortunately, I was in Cincinnati, so they believed me."
"People with limited funds always ask: How do I get started in crypto investing? The SKRAPS ICO (  provides a micro investing platform by allocating spare change from daily purchases. New or experienced, your savings will emulate a high performing portfolio!"
"The Merkle listed me as one of the top 6 influencers in the Crypto sphere. Keep in mind: This same magazine, to the best of my memory, ran a story a few years back about giant grasshoppers eating small children."
Luke - our Cryptocurrency long term analyst (holdings &gt; 6 months) has been with us 8 months. He always takes his own advice. Here is a tiny partial result of his recommendations 6 months ago stashed in the garage of one of our staff houses.
Cyber attacks threaten anyone who uses the Internet and the cryptocurrency sector has virtually no security. The Cryptosecure platform is a serious answer. Every transaction is the equivalent using a new computer. You cannot hack what you cannot see!
"ETHERHIVE got a new name and and a new Website. Definitely download the beta and start using it and read the white paper. A Blockchain based Twitter replacement that is owned by the user base is irresistible. Plus, each message can be up to 500 characters"

"If you're on Facebook more than Discord or Telegram, the No BS Crypto FB mastermind group may be more your fit. Only available via this invite link:"

"For the hundreds who constantly ask: Tomorrow, at around 6:00 PM GMT, Sether (SETH) will be listed on HITBTC. A good time to buy before the platform is fully developed (late summer completion). The platform will completely disrupt existing e-commerce."
"The ICO market is intensely competitive.   is one of the few that's standing out. Their modest $1M soft cap was reached in 10 hours during initial pre sale and, historically, this pattern is an indication of success. Investors should check this out."
"The McAfee Team early morning crew. Luke's ""onesie"" is being considered for the official team uniform."
"Here is the problem with the impersonator accounts on Twitter: I received this thank you from the apparently real Justin Sun, and had to spend time assuring myself before I could reply. No-one has the time to do this. Is this really where we are headed?"
"On my recommendation, ETHERHIVE is changing its name to HIVEWAY. Also, anti-counterfeit measures are coming that will ensure, using photo, alias similarities and behavior algorithms, that profiles are genuine and that public influencers cannot be impersonated by malicious users."
"Samsung to include VPN, ""Courtesy"" of McAfee. McAfee does nothing as a courtesy."
My Army (The Crypto Connection) resides at: @cryptoconnectio btw. Good folks.

"I recently hung out with Charles Nader, founder of   His passion and genuine concern for free healthcare is why Docademic is revolutionizing the world. Check out my interview:"
"WARNING: The Tron airdrop ad placed all over my site yesterday is stealing private keys when you visit the site. Even though Twitter verified the poster's account as being the real Justin Sun, it was a fake account. If you visited the site your private keys were likely stolen."
The site and the Twitter account of the fake Justin Sun have been taken down. These are the posts and the site. If you visited this site you have been compromised.
The scammers are becoming problematic. Twitter has been no help. When I go into protected tweet mode my Twitter app crashes because it cannot handle the volume of follow requests. Do not fall for ANY giveaways. I do not give away anything.
"Market value of alt coins follows Bitcoin, only more so. Bezop price has dropped in half. There is no better time to buy! Bezop will rise, even more so, as BTC marches forward! Bezop blockchain ecommerce cannot lose in the long term."
"For the hundreds who have asked how to apply for a job here, simply show up. If you are smart enough to be part of our team, then you are smart enough to figure out where to show up, and what to do after you've arrived."
"Some folks are perturbed because some of our team drink or even toke weed on the job.  We have no rules. But ..... If anyone becomes less than the best, we ask them to leave. If you want to shoot heroin and yet continue to be the best programmer on the planet, then have at it."
"McAfee Team first shift - 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM. Second shift works from 7:00 PM to 7:00 AM. It's always business hours somewhere in the world, so we are always responsive."

My interview on RT where I ridicule the allegation of Russian Meddling in our elections. They did not. And they were not the most likely candidates given the world wide unpopularity of the US.
My team begged for a website. Believed we'd look professional. More likely we'll just frighten people. We are a ragged bunch and my senior staff look like thugs . But I only work with precocious people - an odd bunch.. We are the best. Prepare yourselves:

"Leaving the Blockchain SuperConference. A moving experience. We spoke of the war waged against us by banks, governments and the establishment, and we vowed to stand firm against it. Alarmingly, some of our youth have been oblivious. But please, young ones, wake up! We need you!"
"3,000 of my followers unfollowed me today. An awesome day! New followers outpaced them so a net gain, but for new followers: if your skin is thin, if you're fragile, uncertain, hesitant, narrow minded, bigoted, self-righteous or inflexible -- save yourself discomfort and unfollow"

"China bans ICOs and cryptos but it can't be enforced. Banks refuse ICO and crypto payments, but we have alternatives. Technology always overcomes legislation. This is truth. ICOs are our future and must be fought for, and crypto is our right. Stand on our side without fear."
Naive followers are getting scammed by imposters and the hundreds of other devious scam masters that are proliferating. This is a nicely done video that will help newcomers to the crypto world avoid potential catastrophe:

For the thousands of you who whine every time I bring a coin or an ICO to your attention:
"Fraud Alert:   is a complete fake. They have copied the old Bezop (BEZ) ICO website word for word, changing only the name. Site has been verified safe to view but DO NOT enter any data."
"Banks are scared shitless. If they had self awareness they would rush to hire the best of us to help transform them into something useful in the new order, but their strategic thinking has frozen. They cannot see that fighting crypto is futile. Only cooperation will save them."
Banks are running scared and stooping to desperate measures. This is proof that Crypto is winning against the old order. Those with the right kind of eyes can clearly see where investment money will flow --- to crypto credit card companies.

Working with Insurepal (ipl) in their time zone - ensuring their product will be timely and perfect. #CryptoLife #NeverSleeps #LoveMyJob #StayStrapped
"Request: those who perpetually yell ""stop"", ""nobody cares"", ""just shut up"", etc., please just unfollow me. Isn't that easier than forcing me to block you?"
"I am changing the day and time that I do the coin of the week. Which of these does everyone prefer? (Those who repeat themselves with ""nobody cares"" please block yourselves, and save me the trouble):"
Well ... slightly less than 100 billion. My addition and subtraction skills are virtually non-existent:)
"For those of you who asked ""Which drop?"" - over 100 billion dollars lost in one morning:"
"So ... here is an odd co-incidence: just minutes before I tweeted the coin of the week, the entire crypto market tanked between 15% to 25%. The Syscoin that I recommended was the only coin relatively unaffected. I'm not a believer in co-incidence. Any thoughts good people?"
"Coin of the week: SYSCOIN (SYS). Blockchain Foundry, in partnership with Microsoft have provided a SYSCOIN wallet like no other. Creates a distributed and flexible on-line marketplace that enables co-operation alongside competition. Has encrypted messaging, aliases and more."
"Actually ... I think I may be safe. It's a sound investment and the MOOZICORE team would have to fuck up royally not to succeed. But, knowing my wife, and just to be safe, I did go onto the Dark Web and hired a hit man to sit in their offices until the danger has passed."
Anyone out there can offer me a safe haven for a few months until we know how the dice has rolled?
"If anyone doubts the sustained viability of cryptocurrencies, then please observe the increasing adoption by our children.  Their views and understandings will be the foundation of their adult generation and those views will mold the world.    via @youtube"
"Again ... dont panic. Banks in India are cracking down on accounts connected to crypto exchanges, causing the dip. But distributed exchanges are only a few months away. Impossible to crack down on."
"Have been watching and advising the developers at SUBSTRATUM -   I like their platform, their attitude and their work. The wise should keep an eye on them."
We all had a blast!
MOOZICORE ICO seems on track. A goid investment for the ICO adherents among you.
For those of you who do not believe that my whole body is tattooed.
Just arrived in Svalbard. Trying to buy a bathing suit.
Janice (wife) and I in Thailand yesterday.
Moozicore reached its soft cap today. Congratulations.
Stopping in Norway on the way home.
Audit of the   ICO which I recommended yesterday. It should answer the many questions about Pod One which I received:
"The media's interpretation of ""Blockchain Cruise Asia"":"
"The ""Blockchain Asia"" 4 A.M. crowd. The ship shut down a couple of hours earlier. The Crypto crowd is resourceful, however. A few Ethereum, a persuasive woman and some committed muscle managed some alcohol and a place to smoke:"
"Want to park your money in a safe place that may have great upside? ICOs are King in this market. Google ""ICOs"" and pick one that resonates. Be sure to fully read the white papers and check out carefully. I'm considering"
"Music Video - ""BUY THE F-CKING DIP"" - Must watch:"
"See this: This dip will drive sellers into fiat - because all crypto is affected. If you don't see that fiat is the walking dead, then you've  missed the power of crypto. No matter where crypto settles, it's value will increase. We all know this. Don't let fear make this worse."
"Keynoting Blockchain Asia in Phuket, Thailand today. One of my most fun keynote addresses:"
Everyone Relax! The Crypto dip was caused by Mike Bell of JP Morgan claiming Governments could ban cryptocurrencies. Well ... how? This is the same company that called BTC a fraud. It's a bank FFS. They are rightfully terrified of what we are doing. But it can't be stopped.
