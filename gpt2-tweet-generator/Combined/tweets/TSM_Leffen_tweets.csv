MELEE #SAVED #SAVESMASH
Also im live now thankful for melee and got some good news today (not melee related) :)
"My Youtube video on the #SaveSmash #FreeMelee topic is out! First of many probably, but recapping everything and going over my thoughts here:"
"Live!  more Nintendo/PM Talk, Summit Review and such :)"
All we are asking for is for Nintendo to leave us alone now if they won't help us. And maybe stop trying to kill the smash scene every year. That's it.  #SaveSmash  #FreeMelee
"But yeah, it feels like I'm preaching to the choir. Somehow people will defend billion dollar companies with their life while laughing and making jokes about innocent childrens fucking trauma to do it."
"Sadly, there will be abusers and predators in any community of any decent size. And especially when that scene is grassroots (you could argue Nintendo couldve helped a lot with). Smash is not the only community with bad people just because we publicly banned ours."
"The amount of people responding to Nintendo's treatment of their community for 10 years by saying ""well this is because of the sexual predators"" is so fucking stupid and disgusting. They invited many of these people to host their events recently, they did not know for 10+ years."
Live! Its time; talking about How Nintendo Killed the Smash Scene #SaveSmash  also some melee practice
"Any ultimate player that sat out and thought #FreeMelee wasn't worth fighting for, I hope you realize now that we've been trying to pull for both games behind the scenes. It's time to wake up."
So excited to watch Marvel tonight :)
"Live! Reviewing summit results/matches, talking Matchups, and #FreeMelee  ALSO METAGAME ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER"
"Gonna try to schleep but shoutouts to summit, was amazing to play and watch everything. Gn"
it still hurts my soul to see how much the FD cp free win momentum switch carries marth players in the matchup though LMAO
zain winning that 3-1 while throwing such an insane amount of stocks and dropping edge guards left and right makes me so happy I invested in Sheik.  Sad for cody tho rip.
Yoo what a set
"""@Garmakilma: Does Yoshi's Story have a short roof?"""

"Streaming online tournaments are exhausting. My stamina is lower too after not having any multi day events in so long. Prob gonna wait to do my youtube vids and such until after, no energy left atm :x  Still, I love being able to play some good fucking melee. #freemelee"

Any EU fox mains who wanna help me warm up :))?

HELP @4tilt
Any EU falcos who can help me warm up :)?
Round 1 of Summit starting now
"Live.  Going to be talking about #FreeMelee in a few, make a YT video, and also warm up &amp; play in Summit in 2 hours"
Honestly feels incredibly weird to play in a tournament today. I will try my best to get my mind in a competitive mood but man I just want to save melee. I'll try to record one or two youtube videos before the tournament. Got a lot to say.
More awful stuff by @NintendoAmerica
Absolute PR bullshit. Slippi does not require illegally obtained versions of the game to function. Backing up games and emulation has been proven several times to be legal in US court cases.  #FreeMelee
also check out   to say screw Nintendo in the best way possible. An easy and free way to play Melee online with amazing netcode and instant matchmaking.
So spread this however you can. Call @NintendoAmerica and email them and BE NICE &amp; RESPECTFUL WHEN YOU DO IT (this decision was not made by some dude sitting in customer support). Get #FreeMelee trending and get another one tomorrow I'll make a youtube video about it tmrw as well
"They went back on it once in 2013 after trying to cancel a tournament that, again, was completely legal and raised almost $100000 for charity. Publishers tried to do the same thing with Dragon Ball Fighterz recently too, and eventually gave in after all the negative publicity."
"due to it being simple code injection with no assets from Nintendo, they use the outdated copyright system to take down the tournaments anyway. The same can and will be done for youtube videos, streams, twitter videos, you name it. Seriously, we need to show that this is not OK."
"I hope other gaming communities realize that if Nintendo gets away with this, it opens the door up for every game publisher to Cease and Desist any tournament series that doesn't follow their rules perfectly. They are doing this because of Slippi, but since Slippi is legal -"
"But hey guys, at least Nintendo supports the scene by forcing tournament streams to play Ads!   #FreeMelee"
Just incredibly sad that they would do such a thing. Nintendo is going out of its way to hurt our community yet again while trying to play nice and invite us to market their new games. Its baffling how stupid and greedy they are.
Nintendo shooting itself in the foot just like EVO 2013. Sadly at this point I'm far from surprised.
"imagine the year 2022, Covids finally gone, PS5s and Xbox series Xs are in stock in every store. You can hug people again and go out and drink with no guilt. You wake up on a sunday morning, boot up the most recent Street fighter game on your PS5 Pr0, and pick Ken."
"Live! Capcom /SF6 leaks, Summit preview (starting soon!"
Third day of bad sleep. At least decentish sleep schedule but man I don't know how the fuck to function atm. Esp because bad sleep fucks up my already shitty stomach :(
why did i do it again

Queen's Gambit is the juice I need
"I cooked myself a nice steak HOLY SHIT suddenly the world doesn't suck anymore  Sorry for being grumpy, I'll make sure to sleep &amp; eat better for tomorrow -_-"

also can contribute to Smurf tournament but not EU FeelsEUMan
"Summit prizemoney   FeelsEUman  Really happy summit is doing anything at all to be clear, super grateful, but the smurf tournaments STINGS LMAO"
Summit preview &amp; Summit practice! Melee time :o
Live!  Starting off with Tekken and talking about how I don't hate it anymore? (at least as much :))  then Summit practice with all the top players! Drama talk if I'm bored/people sub ;)
Link if anyones interested. If you want to learn tekken quickly its basically required IMO  Obviously should not be used for tournaments but yeah
"Playing Tekken with the new Tekken Overlay actually has me enjoying it at times - there were always options like this, but they all were scuffed unintuitive.   Sad its not a default option in the game tbh, hopefully it is for Tekken 8."
Smash drama WeirdChamp  summit practice? pOg  Lets talk about it
Controversial Unnamed Smash Player Cheats Online  then Melee practice for Summit!
its over for me fam first DMCA and now this?
*uses overlay that shows frame data in playermatches once* tekken stans:
going to CHEAT in TEKKEN aka use the Tekken Overlay to see frames and how bad/good the netcode is
Dbfz national championship is such a terrible look for bandai namco lmao. Who would've guessed that making people play online in terrible netcode for no prizepool would've turned out like this /s
Ring fit is so pog man
Any nice scalpersss??
whats the hookup for ps5s in sweden? LUL
i think its a sign of both how normalized racism has been after trump and also how fragile tekken stans are
like people take more offense these days to saying that their favorite game is bad than people thinking that they think minorities are worth less jfc
"it'll never stop being funny to me that I need to ban literally 10 times more people if I stream tekken and say the games bad/flawed than when I streamed the election and said that you can basically assume that every trump voter is either racist, stupid or ignorant LMAO"
"Testing Slippi Stats, talkin a lil melee, then Tekken chill"
melee
"Kunimitsu is like the by far most visually polished character but her gameplay feels like an unpolished mess at times.  She's still fun though, playing her teaches you about how to be an absolute cheeselord online lmao"
LOOKS LIKE A MID TO ME BRO
"I'm curious, can you stream or make youtube videos of Yuzu emulator Ultimate? Anyone with experience in the area, heard nintendo takes down videos.   Please tag people who have experience with this, trying to do some sick stuff :)"
"It basically means that I have been playing with 2 extra frames of delay for a while now LMAO  The way to fix mine was to turn off Gsync for melee, others said they fixed theirs by changing the refresh rate on a different monitor after opening melee up."
"By the way, everyone should check to make sure that their Melee is running in 144/240hz if you have the monitor for it.  Mine had a bug where it would do 240hz everywhere but fullscreen melee, you can check it by turning on your monitor display (use the physical buttons on it)."
"I have won Poilon Arena #3, attaining another World Championship to my collection of trophies, and further cementing my 100% winrate in the GOAT Region, not even losing a set. Previous wins this year includes World Champion titles with Random and Sheik as well.  Good games!"
any fox mains EU that wanna help me warmup :)?
Live! Playing in the Poilon EU tournament today! 128+ MAN TOURNAMENT OMGFGZ!!  the fox returns :)
I don't think I've ever turned into a stream of Tekken Ranked without hearing the streamer say that the opponent is either a terrible scrub and a masher or a smurf when the streamer is losing.  yeah man I agree tbh
"it was fun, not that many top players  showed up though! Y'all need this a lot more than I do bitches, so you guys better show up next time or I'm just gonna stop trying to make u better."
Kunimitsu ranked -&gt; Melee ELITE EU SESH  come experience hell with  me
Shit twitch finally with an amazing response that clears up everything!
"Going to do a pre Poilon EU Melee practice session today!  Starting at 8:30, so in 3 hours.  Lets get warmed up for tomorrows tournament, I wanna play all the EU top players in a gauntlet and everyone else can play eachother too. Gather in my twitch :) Tag ppl u wanna see me play"
Melee patch notes Pog
"Tekkens netcode with its online is not THAT good, but honestly its so many times better than dbfz or ultimates that it really makes me wish I liked the game itself a bit more. I can't fucking wait for the next generation of fighting games with actual great rollback."
Kunimitsu is fun! Not sure if she's great but shes definitely not bad. Like most tekken characters she has a crapton of moves and plenty of gimmicks. Her movement and punish game is legit tho
"Kunimitsus i14 frame punisher, requires you to buffer F (N) D DF 2 during blockstun. 86 damage midscreen with wall scaling nerfs :o  ...I call it ""the leffen"" ;)"
"Live! Going to be trying out Kunimitsu, the new Tekken 7 character, then going to experiment more with the netcode and try out the new Ranked system."
"the tekken netcode seems like a pretty decent improvement but its still far from as good proper rollback games. Still, a step above SFVs shitty implementation for sure!"
"This shows that its fixable however, so lets please try to get em to fix this."
"They actually reduced rematching someone in ranked, but not in lobbies. First loadtime vs someone is still ~50 seconds then though, and most people leave after 1 game or 2."
"Today in Tekken I learned: You can not play vs a CPU offline. You can not set a password for a lobby, you literally have to add them to your steam account if you want a private session.  JFC"
#1 tekken hater and childrens party game pro tries the new season of Tekken 7 that supposedly has Rollback Netcode

a little melee &amp; chill maybe some GG later
Tekken season 4 impressions so far?

Georgia and Pennsylvania üëÄ
Streaming games on twitch makes me feel like an alien. The amount of people who have absolutely zero empathy about anxiety around the election is insane.
i'll definitely enter next week regardless of what happens.
"Going to try to enter Poilon Arena today but honestly I'll have to see how I feel.  Feeling really spent because of the election and taking Lajm to the vet tomorrow for a checkup, so not sure if I can do a 130man online tournaments today.  I'll try and see how I feel though!"
"GG is fun but I need to grind it a lot more, too much to learn lmao. I will say, some of the stages and some effects are hilariously bad for visual clarity, its making me miss newer games in that regard for sure.  It'll be really good practice for Strive tho :)"
"Playing some Melee, Guilty gear and monetizing my anxiety about the election :)"
How come every time a Marth gets a grab they are so devastating in their percentage and power of destruction?
"Obviously this tweet is not meant to imply that every single person in america is bad, but close to half of the country voting for Trump absolutely does say a lot about the country as a whole. Regardless of who ends up taking it."
Looking like Biden might squeeze out a win but it'll take a while. Honestly so disgusted that it's even close but I'm not sure why I expected anything less from America.
Going to try to sleep. Try.
"Not gonna stream today, been really low energy lately and today seems to be a good day to take a break :)  Btw you better vote if you can üôè"

"Been saying this. Get on it. Cloud parsec servers is something that other communities with far better regular netcode have started using.  For something as bad as regular Ult online, there's no excuse. This is the perfect year to do it, get to work lads."

"Stream will return today, but I'm going to drop out of the Poilon tournament because I'm still too tired to play in a huge tournament. Chill stream :)"
"Finally feeling better today health wise, officially on the other side of a real horrible food poisoning/stomach bug or smth.  Unlikely to stream though, sorry =("
Retweeting for awareness - no personal thoughts on it atm.
"Still feeling like shit, probably got a stomach bug or something. No stream today and probably tomorrow at least."
"Feeling really under the weather, so not going to be able to stream today. No cough/fever so hopefully its not covid but you never know üò∑"
Idk looks very unlikely. Rip :(
"travel restrictions basically make us/canada impossible, but mexico has literally no travel restrictions... Idk if thats a bad or a good sign ROFL"
Ok nvm travel restrictions basically make it impossible
"Canada looks like the right option for sure, but not sure on travel restrictions atm and such. Idk maybe there's a chance"
tournament is also right after the election so everything might be on fire
someone tell me the risks and guide to traveling to america by plane to enter a video game tournament online lmao  legit got no idea how feasible it is tbh.
anyone got a boat with fiber internet?
"damn, so soon. Hopefully I can work something out ((if im invited)) but idk :o"
More tournaments I can't enter üò≠ Happy for melee tho!
Was fun doing commentary! It's a bit hard to not talk over each others because of a bit of extra delay but hope you guys liked it :)
"New Podcast out!  @C9Mang0 , @ZainNaghmi  and myself talking about the GOAT debate, Melee's meta and how online really actually matters. The podcast is also out on Itunes/Spotify/Google play &amp; more now :) RT pls because the algorithm hates melee content :("
"If this was 2018 the debate would've already been solved, THAT'S HOW MUCH BETTER WE WERE"
how long will this meta debate go on lmfaoooo
"Live!  Doing Mango &amp; the 6-4 Podcast in an hourish, playing @ZainNaghmi until then"
played 3 hours and i feel like I have to stretch for 4
I hate how sports are limited in how much you can play per day LMAO the gamer in me wants 12 hours a dayyy
any eu top players want the quickest lil sesh?

"Live! Eating Food, Talking about Hbox ""dropping out"" of Slippi league, and more! then WHALING in Genshin impact :)"
BOXX PLAYERS HAVE MAGIC DI (CLICKBAIT) lmfao
"I have now acquired a PHD in marth chaingrabs after reading this and what I got from it is that I already did it semi consistently and boxx players can do it everytime   oh boy, full analysis later. Great stuff!"
"guys I cracked it. Armada is an anagram of Madara.  Armada, or well, Madara Uchiha as he's actually called, stays alive in a cave for hundred of years, just to come back out into the world and show everyone the meta hasn't changed, truly cementing his Eternal G.O.A.T Status."
"Idk, its complicated, full video on YT tomorrow"
"Whether its right or wrong (its usually wrong) - people will always care more about who's doing sick shit right now rather than X years ago, and that's how it should be if you want any scene to live long term.  But we also can't disrespect the people that did put in their time."
"to wanna say what you think when people argue that Armada ""would no longer be good"" (obv ridiculous), but at the end of the day its something will definitely do regardless because no player owns their legacy. People can and will endlessly debate over this shit."
"My TLDR on the recent drama: GOAT debates are insanely silly, especially for games that are still active. Saying meta hasn't changed much as a retired top pro is ultimately bad for the scene and a bad look even if its your honest opinion. But its also completely understandable -"
"Live! GOAT melee debate (a little), rollback legitimacy and more!"
Giving Jennie money to Gacha in genshin impact (new banner)
Also personally I think melee's meta didn't change as much in 2019 because of many people playing Ultimate but since rollback came out it has started to develop much faster than any time since wavedashing was found.  More talk about it on the podcast tonight :)
"Had to go into town for stupid US tax shit, but had time to get some Yakiniku :)"
"Streaming! Talking Slippi league, melee goats but mostly ANGRY GRIND also starting vtuber career"
my melee goat: ‚ùåArmada  ‚ùåMango if he quit 2015 ‚ùåM2K if he quit in 2008 ‚ùåJavi if he traveled  ‚ùåKen if he won survivor ‚ùåFizzi for developing Slippi ‚ùåIsai if he tried like a wobbling IC in unranked ‚òëÔ∏èSakurai for making Brawl so unbelievably bad everyone kept playing melee.
my heart is right here.
"Love watching Slippi, great melee every week!  some really good matches and some really bad salt tweets (myself included lmao), always fun af"
"can we please ban using skins/widescreen hack for slippi tournaments super frequent desyncs when those are involved, at least skins"
I don't think theres anything wrong with dropping out of an online event in a game with miserable online and it is essentially unpaid marketing no prizepool  for a company that doesn't care enough about you to add a wifi indicator. Obviously not entering wouldve been better tho.
"Restreaming Slippi, talking my set and such :) lil salty stream, pity subs to the left pls"
"Gotta get used to the netplay salt lmao, losing in your room and not being able to leave the venue sucks"
dealing with unexpected stuff like this is definitely the hardest thing to get used when coming back to a competitor. I need to plan for things to go south so I'm mentally ready for when they do. Definitely happy I don't have to compete for quite a while though LMAO
sheik is showing good progress so you take those i suppose
really sad to prep for a week and then get 0 warmup cuz of schedule fuckups but it happensssssssssssssssssssssss
"Fun times to play &amp; commentate, frustrating to lose in such a way but all things considered I'm happy with how I performed.   GGs Zain, I'll be back stronger next time."
"I'll see if I have time to stream some, maybe a little between my commentary/matches"
"Going to be commentating the @BTSsmash Slippi League today! Its been quite a while so I hope I still remember how haha.  Also playing a set vs @ZainNaghmi , first real set in a while too, excited to get back into it!"
oh @Pricents
any EU marth players that wanna play today? @Makenshissbm @SSBMahie etc
LIVE! Watching Slippi Open Bracket &amp; preparing for my match tomorrow
Watching Cody vs Hbox  FT6 - 5000 DOLLARS
Birthday Boy Melee :) Playing @ZainNaghmi later and Watching IBDW HBox 5k mm
"they did call me ""ran after every ball like he was a hall of fame rebounder"" in the locker room when they thought i wasn't listening LMAO"
I'm gonna earn the respect fuck these kids I'm not a bitchass roleplayer
"Played pickup 4v4 ball for an hour with randoms  and they wouldn't give the birthday boy the ball, had to rebound and steal everytime"
"Thanks for all the birthday wishes! So many, I'm blessed to have so many great friends ;-; I am going to celebrate my birthday the only way I know how, by playing basketball and melee :)"
GG -R getting rollback support! That's a pretty dope birthday gift ;) Now just give us ranked pls
"yo i wanna bet on hbox ibdw maybe, can anyone be my bookie its us only"
"Birthday Melee stream :) Going to grind for my Slippi league match, and watch some of last weekends!"
it is my birthday woo
Any EU/US East coast players that wanna grind tonight? Pref fox/marth
I just love how butthurt ultimate kids get LMAO
also we have ledgegrab limits lmao
people said the same thing when I called byleth not being good too. Slow characters are almost never good in a competitive setting unless they are UNBELIEVABLY broken - and I think Steve has some top tier moves but not enough to make up for his terrible mobility and speed.
L M A O   yeah just be literally frame perfect twice per second you stall and also hope they don't take the edge and if they do you die   ultimate kids trying to trash melee never gets old  if you wanna fire some shitty shot at least point to puff or sheiks ledgestalling lmfao
I swear every Ultimate DLC but Joker/Terry is just a degenerate ass mid-low tier
"Live! FINALLY trying Steve for the first time, and 9.0 patch notes review!"
"Thanks for the tips! Sadly theres no gyms with a basket ball hoop/court in stockholm as far as I know, and renting a court each time is annoying. I'll try handwarmers!"
Any tips for gear to play basketball when its colder? The first 30 minutes are brutal on the hands lmao
oh yeah and you can't training mode and queue up for ranked anymore... even noobs can go to the top floors so good players will have no way to make sure they play equally skilled opponents...
"""we removed ranked so you don't feel stressed when you play ranked points'  but you added a system that judges every casual in lobbies???? and will kick you out mid session???"
Remember when everyone said they definitely changed it because they said so?  removing ranked?    keeping the hideous and buggy pixel lobby?  Jesus christ.
why.
"Too tired to try Steve and the new patch today, had myself a big bulking taco tuesday and got the biggest food coma :)"
And NESS?
"so you're saying they didn't do any changes to online, and buffed Richter/simon, lucario and Sonic?"
When does the steve patch go live?
NOT AS MUCH AS I FEEL FOR MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS OF COURSE
ultimate patch today and I feel for everyone who will stop playing games they enjoy to stream ultimate online for views  (myself included maybe ;))
"Live! Bootcamping since I'm playing in the Slippi league next week, and watching sets from yesterdays tournament! :)"
(from @Sajam s stream :) )
"""LEFFEN WHY DONT U WATCH THE STREAM, THEY SAID THEY FIXED IT""  the stream:"
"(yes I know they're _trying_ to fix some issues, but the fact is that the average viewer only se the beta shitstorms and youtube trailers - they don't read developer essays that promise things but won't show them)"
"""That'll be 100 dollars sir"""
"What other Multiplayer focused genre  does this anymore?  Only fighting game devs are stupid enough to try to create an active playerbase with a $100 tryout fee, while competing with much more approachable F2P models that let you try and get hooked easily."
"This trend of $60-90+fighting games needs to to die. It usually ends up with $130-150 with DLC after 2 years as well.  Fighting games are hard to get into as is, the stupid high price coupled with lacking casual content and ALWAYS lots of problems at launch... its not the way."
"Also shoutouts to the heat, made me a fan for sure."
Big shoutouts to the NBA for an amazing bubble
Well deserved Lakers :)
This is a rough one
Slippi league has been great but I'm gonna have to stop watching to watch basketball real soon :o Might do a rewatch tomorrow
What a stomp
"Live! Slippi league Preview, my own Slippi league matches &amp; announcing two online tournaments I'm going to be hosting myself :)  Today‚Äôs stream is #sponsored by Raid: Shadow Legends free to play on PC. Click this link to download!"
if the netcode is shit we riot.
"Guilty Gear Strive presentation was pretty cool, I love the new character designs and the gameplay seems pretty fun. PC and PS4/PS5 coming out April 1st is nice. I want more specific stuff about online though, so little focus was put on it."
"Millia with no pin and not insane movement seems meh, but obv super early"
"they just said theyre still changing more, not expecting anything honestly but hopeful I guess"
"better, but why the hell do these graphic designers use ten different fonts??"
"they added ""punish"" notification though which is a really good thing from Granblue"
"UI for GG Strive looks like dogshit still, insanely big combo counters and super weird colors and a billion fonts. Lifebars slightly improved I guess, but really disappointing that this is all they've done so far"
"Giovanna looks dope, much cooler for new chars compared to elphelt and such"
"New Mango &amp; the 6-4 podcast is up! Discussing the online Smash league (aka slippi league) Pollfix, Hbox unretiring &amp; more! Ft myself, @C9Mang0 and @ZainNaghmi"
"its hilarious cuz these are top eu players who are ranked and they'll just come in and say ""haha ggs :D"" if im streaming, but start tea bagging and quitting out after 2 stocks because I did two zero to deaths lmfao"
three more in a row
the amount of people who ragequit vs me in melee or eventually start raging is legit like 95% in unranked LMAO  just cuz they don't recognize my tag
"lebron played out of this world good, and yet jimmy + duncan won it for heat. amazing game."
"Insanely close game, can't wait for sunday holy shit."
Bro what is happening
What a gameee
This is one crazy game
TWITCH RIVALS IS LIVE TEAM MELEE @ZainNaghmi @toph_bbq @Legend0fLucky
"Hacking my gamecube controller, then playing in Twitch Rivlas (Fall guys) with team Melee ft. @ZainNaghmi @toph_bbq @Legend0fLucky"
"Live! Going to overclock the shit out of my gamecube controller, then doing the Podcast! Come give me topics."
"The podcast returns today, what topics do you want me, @C9Mang0  and @ZainNaghmi  to talk about?"
in happier news I'm getting a lot better at basketball and that rewards me with better mental and physical health and doesn't reward time put into it by punching me in the balls.
"the worst part is that the better you get at a game, the more you suffer due to the shit online. me and the tekken reddit have a less toxic relationship than a pro fighting game player has with his delay based game.  doing a shit fighting games detox from now on lmfao"
like its a fucking problem when I spend 150 dollars on genshin impact for jpgs as a meme and its still feels like I get less ripped off
"like its not even just the netcode, I get that it could be hard to switch to rollback. But fucking let us set the delay, let us see wifi indicators, punish ragequitters and lagswitchers, fucking fix the lobbies, loadtimes, fucking anything. You pay $120+for a miserable experience"
"every time i go from playing a rollback netcode back to the fucking garbage online like DBFZ, Granblue and Tekken I just get so fucking sad and angry. Fighting games that are this bad in 2020 do not fucking deserve mine or anyone elses attention lmao."
"If you've tried the overclocking fix for Gamecube controllers, did you notice a difference and if so where?"
Does Wasapi Audio work well with slippi? When I try it its either mute or robot sounding depending on audio device lmao
really fun game of basketball
Live! Playing my favorite game Super Smash Brothers Melee For The Nintendo Gamecube Genshin or Rivals after!
"I do really miss traveling and getting actual breaks from the internet obsessing over every word you say though, even if most of the trips I'd take were for tournaments lmao. But I'll find a way to deal with it, its still not much compared to how rough others have it."
"Thanks to everyone for supporting me as well, I know this will get memed but I am very happy this year especially to be able to stream and make content fulltime even if the negatives/toxicity drives me crazy sometimes. A lot of really nice people make up for the shitty ones :)"
Feels crazy that its already October. Been a crazy year but it feels like its barely started somehow. I've been extremely lucky with all things considered but its still been pretty rough at times. I hope you all are hanging in there as well.
I have not yet spent money on genshin impact but it is getting harder by the minute
Melee is always here for me some late night melee and then probably later night genshin impact
"Awful as an idea, but coupled with its insanely bad execution and balancing - a contender for the single worst fighting game mechanic in history"
Been very low energy but today I shall attempt to stream
God damn Jimmy
gotta make it look close so the ring means something boys
"I feel like in Basketball, winning 4-0 is considered less impressive than winning 4-3 lmao. It's so hilarious to me."
tyvm for the help everyone :)
"FIXED! fuck yeah, seems to have been NVIDIA overlay despite everything on in (instant replay etc) being off... lol"
"update: screen flickering is not appearing in recordings, so most likely just a sideeffect of fps dropping"
anyone got ideas?
"For some reason one of my computers lag in 3D games when I move my mouse (even if it doesn't affect the camera). It also makes the screen flicker black very slightly lol.  Tried with 2 different mice, both plugged in and wireless. drivers up to date."
I need to try workshop first before im ready to do the video tho.
"Feeling more or less done with Rivals, unfortunately very disappointed but I'm excited for the rumored rivals 2. I will do a review/first impressions first though, and then move on to the next smash like and do the same. Rushdown revolt or slayers for hire next."
Watching the minecraft steve gameplay direct
I wanna spend all the time I can with my boy üò≠
Streams will be inconsistent for a while.. Our cat Lajm is going through a rough time and probably needs to be put to sleep soon ;__;  I'm doing alright for now but its hard to be in front of thousands of people in times like this so shorter/fewer streams is to be expected.
"Basketball is the only thing keeping me sane :/ Rolled my (other) ankle very lightly today though so I have to take a break for a few days at least :( At least I feel like I've improved greatly recently, and the NBA is still on."
"Sorry no podcast today, something urgent came up. Probably doing it tomorrow."
LMAO @TweekSsb
ROFL STEVEEEE WE DID IT
Lets watch the new smash reveal! STARTING NOW Rivals after
ALSO PODCAST RETURNS TOMORROW
"gonna stream the dante for smash reveal tomorrow, turning off twitter and sleeping soon so I don't get spoiled for the finals game, cya all tomorrow :)"
also it's just a fucking joke on myself because I was stupid to compare games to jobs before lajdjskake take a chill pill jeez
"overall I'd rate it a $40000 a year in Orlando, Florida out of ten ;)"
Sound design especially was a huge deal. I've never realized how much I cared about it until I played this lol. Obviously some people don't care at all but it's a huge deal to me.
"Very divided on rivals of aether so far, really cool character designs, nice stages and great ost, but terrible visual/sound design for almost every move, awful camera that makes me feel sick, and very bad online.  Just day 1 though, going to play more tommorow."
Aight trying RIVALS OF AETHER for the first time in like 3 years
"Live! Discussing New Smash DLC, Tekken Season 4, and playing DBFZ and then Rivals :)"
So excited for the lakers vs the heat üèÄüèÄ
"Many people don't have a choice but to work minimum wage jobs to survive, and honestly it was really insensitive to compare them, especially during covid-19 where some people are struggling harder than ever.  Going to turn of twitter now because I'm avoiding üèÄ spoilers, peace :)"
"Overall I made a real fucking shitty tweet, and I'm sorry. I'm very lucky to have any and all support to be able to be a content creator full time and I seriously think minimum wage jobs are awful and there NEEDS to be change."
"But I do think it has its drawbacks like every job. Having to be in front of people every day and be constantly judged for everything you say can out of context be awful. If you add having to act entertaining for a game you dislike, it can be terrible.  This tweet was my B tho :)"
"choose to work a minimum wage job for that wage, especially in america where both the working conditions and pay are straight up inhuman at times.  Overall I'm EXTREMELY lucky to be able to stream and create content as a job, and I really enjoy being able to do it."
"And that to me, the work of doing that for a game you didn't enjoy (hated online) in front of thousands of people was far worse than working a minimum wage job 40 hours a week where I could turn my brain off _IF I WOULDVE GOTTEN PAID THE SAME AMOUNT_.  I definitely would not-"
It makes you wonder why dbfz hasn't even commented on including a wifi indicator like tekken when its also developed by bandai namco. Can't believe I'm turning to a tekken stan
Dbfz is so insanely bad to play on regular online. Either gonna see if people wanna setup a cloud server or stop playing again.  At least basketballs netcode is great :)
"almost everything else in the update seems fine, but this change is going to make tekken so insanely toxic lmao"
"Tekken is specifically adding a huge penalty if you lose 3 matches in a row to someone. No bonus if you win 3 mentioned. In a game where lagswitching, ragequitting and literally copy pasting your rank is completely risk free and not punished whatsoever.  What the fuck."
DONT DO THIS. DON'T GIVE ME HOPE
The new tekken update ACTUALLY seems good. What the...
"ALSO if you guys really want good online ultimate that badly, then just get to work on setting up emulator parsec. It's literally right there."
heh
"and yeah, my initial tweet applied to me too. Offline was so much better than online that it felt good, until about a year in when I realized midway through the pre dreamhack bootcamp that being better than shit wasn't good enough"
obviously some people fucking love it but many of yall did not show that when tournaments were around and noone was touching the setups from the moment they lost in bracket
"honestly i think if ultimates netcode wasnt turbo garbage i think people would realize its flaws as a competitive fighting game way faster, but maybe thats just me. the online is so bad that you cant even focus on the fact that ""gameplay"" consisting of pacman vs rob isnt that fun"
"Belial is my favorite fighting game character that I've tried in a loooong time. Definitely playing more tomorrow, and then moving to Japan to keep playing because this game is dead af here"
"the return to GRANBLUE checking out belial, and the new patch with the new online changes"
warming up @GARMAKILMA for a tournament then playing Granblue/Rivals today :)
If the next generation of fighting games are as garbage as this one and the last one then I'm retiring and becoming a Vtuber Card games streamer in japan fuck this shit
;_;
dbfz but its online
"NO SLEEP extremely tired lets play dbfz rivals/granblue tomorrow, too tired"
DBFZ is my favorite party game
"Live! Starting off with DBFZ, then checking out Belial and the new season for Granblue, then maybe Rivals to finish"
"basically every 21 team should have some setups like this, really important if you wanna run a21 second or third (imo her best positions cuz of broken lvl 3 mix and great assist)"
"When you can't crossup with J.2H you can do this instead. Kinda height dependent, but can also work from 5H routes if you get them high enough."
"Super useful route, works from any normal starter and super easy."
"does not work on smalls, prob not super useful. Use ex Kneedrop instead imo"
"Solo route, probably the most useful, especially if you play her as anchor. Any vanish into corner, works with both grabs."
What a game jeez
Live.  Sold my soul. Learning Kid buu.
Ill give u a tier 3 sub and or 25 likes on twitter
Can some kid buu need give me optimal (but online practical) combos with base veg a and 21 a assists please. Got no idea about combos outside of the generic shit
Streaming! Labbing a new teammate for A21/Base Vegeta Maybe just maybe selling my soul...
"streaming dbfz, tekken later green squares only please i dont want to sweat"
Aight thats enough tweeting for today.
"(like fucking obviously i dont think what cod content creators do is comparable, but how gullible the audience is reminded me of what truly fucked up individuals can do with that position, not at ALL saying hitch is that bad lol please)"
Watching how hard they suck up to someone who cares nothing about them just reminded me of how zero used his youtube audience. Fucking disgusted gonna go barf.
Oh no im getting swarmed on twitter by dudes in faze clan hoodies because i don't like their favorite cod dudebro whatever will I do!!
"btw I told him that unless what he meant to say was ""you can understand whats going on, and SBMM is good for the game and I should stop gaslighting my young audience for my own benefit"" then I don't really think he worded it wrong.  these shitty cod dudebros man."
Him yesterday in my chat. Fucking pathetic.
who also shits on SBMM*
"like why the fuck are you trying to talk about things you obviously have NO idea about, and then claiming I could never understand because I haven't played an FPS. of course you're a pathetic COD content creator who shits on new players shilling on SBMM as well."
i've never seen a worse dunning kruger and I never fucking will
"and yeah, if your game sucks when multiple people are good, then guess what, the game wasn't great to begin with. just smurf or someshit.  oh and don't come at me with the ""its just casual xD"" even casuals care about even matches."
"its very obviously that content creators are trying to trick their audience that you should in fact, not be okay with a system that makes for fair matches and it should instead become favor them so they can make content easier.  it's like watching poor people vote for trump"
"watching people argue that FPS players should in fact, not play people who are as good as them, but people worse than them so they can stroke their ego is so fucking pathetic. what's the joy in beating people up who play once every two weeks if you're playing this shit full time"
"...yes? No but in reality, marvel 3 neutral was crazy interesting and diverse. The movement + assists really changed a MU. You didn't play THAT much of it but outside of a few toxic MUs it was always fun as fuck. Dbfz neutral is just the same shit over and over again."
also i think master roshi is very good but very complicated. luckily his assist is bonkers so hes just barely worth the trouble IMO
"honestly i wish dbfz made the leap and just cut neutral completely and made it a pure turn based fighting game. take turns mixxing each others, no need to spam ex moves/ki blasts/super dash first"
"Back, gonna fuck up @GARMAKILMA in a bit"
Roshis M/H armor moves are fucking hilariously stupid
short DBFZ strim
Roshi is very fun and different Online dbfz is the same and still horseshit
how is master roshi? his assists seems dumb af
YOU LOVE TO SEE IT
"New video! A lot has changed for melee recently, Slippi has changed both how we play and practice it, so its time for  a new tier list :) RT and like the video etc if you want more content like this! ;)"
Which one is a better fit for Kidbuu/Tgohan? Baseku with A assist or Tien with A? Idk if u get much mix with tien A with buu but neutral might be weak with baseku a+teengohan dp assist
"Big video coming out soon tho, get those RTs buttons ready!"
Tired as fuck from a basketball sesh so I'm probably taking tonight off... Also I wanna watch the clippers lose
might fuck around and learn Kid Buu/T.Gohan/B.Goku even tho I've never played a single of those chars before lmfao
iTs A NeRF
"Can someone explain to me why the a21 5m is supposed to be a ""nerf"" because ""it doesnt beat reflect""? You can just delay it to beat it now afaik, what happened pre patch?"
The return once more New DBFZ Patch live now! Finding a new team
any top melee players interested in doing a podcast? just got a spot open up
"Trust me, to me this is just funny and an easy way to get free motivation. I've made my career, won evo &amp; bought my apartment by proving haters wrong. But not everyone should have to in order to enjoy a game. Most people don't feed off hate, they just think ur an ass &amp; quit."
"Hopefully one day the Tekken community will catch up to 2020 and stop gatekeeping. It absolutely hurts your scene, and it'll fuck you over if its still present when the Riot fighter brings in the next wave. You don't own""tekken"" just because you've sucked at it for 5 years more."
"If you don't think getting a high rank quickly is impressive, I implore you to get top ranked in Melee once ranked comes out.  Hell, get top 5% in literally any game that's already established within a month without prior experience or cheating. Its really fucking hard."
"Literally since the first time I ever picked up a fight stick has the FGC tried to gatekeep and downplay anything I achieved. Whether I got rank 1 online in MVCI, DBFZ, people ALLLLLWAYS tries to discredit me because I come from smash. Its wild its still happening in 2020."
In how many hours is the DBFZ patch coming out in?
I HOPE THE GAME DIRECTORS SEE THE ISSUE A SMASHER HAS MADE IT TO A HIGH RANK LMAOOO
Like clockwork üòÖ
"2 weeks ish, maybe 8-9 days of grind 3 more ranks for Tekken god prime  Inb4 omg ur just abusing Zafina!!!"
Late night Tekken Ranked Grind Almost at Emperor...
"The DBFZ showcase was amazing, really wish we could get more of this type of stuff from Fighting game companies!"
Kid Buu Buffed LuL

disliking a game=murder Bullying said person for disliking game: state sanctioned execution  AJDPSJAOPSDADSJD you can't be serious LOL
ROFLLLLLLLLLL
more
upvoted btw in a thread made by a mod what a shithole
LMAOAOAO this is so funny
great stream today also over at r/tekken:
"Live! Wanted Criminal In At Least Two SubReddits Attempts to Get Emperor in Tekken, then Melee tier list?"
"If people want to have a real discussion at some point to clear shit up, I'm down to come on a podcast or whatever with Tekken people, as long as its in good faith and not to stir up more drama. I know @AryaTayebi and @TheMainMan_SWE have expressed interest before,lets set it up"
"Getting clipped out of context sure is tiring. Streaming 10 hours straight without a 10 second clip that can be intentionally taken out of context is impossible lmao. Oh well, what can you do."
Played a long offline UMVC3 session today and god damn this game is the best
"Same guy, different post. Actually hilarious"
"Wake up to literally 5 threads on me on R/Tekken, saying shit like this LMAO. Maybe one day these people will realize that me shitting on a product I've paid 150 dollars for is NOT the same as bullying. (As if)"
"Its good that I don't like tekken, because no game is worth this shithole of a community. I can't imagine having to deal with it for long periods of time."
"and as usual, every single top to decent player has been nice, further confirming my theory that there is nothing more toxic than insecure, underperforming young adult males"
"this shit is making me lose serious faith in humanity lmao, its funny but at this point the 600th comment about ""OK PRATY GAME PLAYERRR"" is getting more sad and pathetic than entertaining."
"shoutouts to the people that do help out tho, but god damn I'm dipping the fuck soon LMAO"
"mustve permabanned over 500 people during my tekken streams, and even then the chat is consistently awful even when I don't say anything. truly astonishing"
"Hopefully season4 is a bit better, and tekken 8 fixes most of my problems.  Tekken 7 is like all other fighting games these days, pretty bad overall. Playing it offline is pretty fun but not good enough for me to compete in imo."
"Tekken improvement going quickly still at least, but man this game has a lot of people who run to save points. Almost got to Ryujin today, Tekken god prime shouldn't be too hard if I keep improving.  After that we're fucking OUT  (and hopefully melee ranked is out)"
What I want personally is just a normal controll stick mounted to regular gamecube stick (nunchucks are bleh). I know I've seen custom made versions but if there's high quality one I'd consider swapping to it.
Interesting to see more options. I'll probably do a review of a boxx controller at some point
"Never liked the meh combat from Dynasty warriors, and couldn't get into the Hyrule Warriors either, but I'll probably try this just cuz I like BOTW lmao"
taking a break from streaming today as well too tired and I wanna watch basketball
Welcome back :)
"Me too man, I hope I can get through these dark times üôèüôèüôè"
gonna do a salt review on stream later :)
seeing people I banned from my twitch channel get salty and make twitter threads and reddit threads is the only juice i need
"New, better thumbnail: ""Why I no longer Solo Main Fox"" @BTSsmash  LMAO"

Live! Getting Blue ranks in tekken then playing Tony hawk or 2k or some shit
"Tried using the record function to lab today.  Can't believe that a $100+ dollar game (dlc, needed for frame data/to lab vs chars) can have a training mode that fucking bad 5 years in."
Every day my tekken rank rises Every day I find 193719 more stupid things about it Maybe when I get worse I will like it more :(
"Live! Playing a bit of tekken, then Fall guys with @GARMAKILMA  then more tekken/melee &amp; talking about the Slippi league!"
"That said hopefully we can catch up somehow,  I got some stuff planned (weekly sessions, my own tournaments) but it really feels harder than ever to keep up right now. When covid-19 goes away I can at least travel and grind slippi there."
"whereas EU still can't enter anything held in America and there far fewer/smaller tournaments here.  I'm luckily good enough to make people play 3F delay with, but its going to be extremely hard for everyone else tbh.  Even for me its hard to stay motivated."
"Feels like Slippi combined with COVID-19 is going to sadly increase the gap even further between EU and US in melee sadly.  We already had good internet for the most part (I could play everyone in EU) , but now NA can play everyone and they get several major netplay tournaments-"
God damn
Went up 3 ranks in tekken cuz i learned more cheese lmao Like 80-90% of my matches were stream snipers :(
Live! Watching the mario direct (no spoilers) then Tekken continues... today we cheese back.

"it is a serious fucking problem, and talking to other streamers it seems like its not at all exclusive to my chat   (many like to blame me for shitting on the game lol, as if that makes it okay for them to shit on me as a person)"
"tekken top players/community figureheads are fine, but tekken reddit/twitch chat/twitter is legitimately the single worst crowd I have ever fucking experienced, and I called Kingdom hearts 3 a 3/10 game on release while not having played the mobile games."
"you can't possibly make this shit up. i'm talking about people intentionally trolling in my chat, and he knows that, yet still feels offended, and then calls the predator card... jfc what a cesspool online tekken is"
woo reddit posts about me calling my tekken chat toxic wew can't wait for the toxic tekken reddit community to defend the great tekken twitch chat
"When I play tekken, it randomly frame drops every 10 seconds, usually when a move hits. I've tried everything, fullscreen, windowed, vsync on off, 1080p and not, high performance mode.  Anyone got any tips?"
Live with Tekken  THE RANKED TORTURE/WAR CONTINUES RANK UP OR I GIFT 20 SUBS
Me playing Tekken
"Ultimates awful online has always been its by far biggest flaw, and its made me and countless others quit the game. But what if I told you, that we can already fix ut ourselves?  Lets get to work.  New Youtube video up now explaining how:"
Watching every other tekken ranked streamer also getting cheesed and hating their life playing has made me feel less bad. Thank u my fellow warriors. The war continues today.
"Honestly, it doesn't have to be a fighting game even. Just any 1v1 game, maybe 2v2/3v3 so the chance of trolls/feeders is lower"
"Is there any fighting game that's decent and has popular ranked mode? Streaming matches with no stakes so energy consuming/boring. I just want a game thats not a terrible experience online with a decent ranked system... Tekken certainly isn't it lmao, maybe SFV?"
mid level online ranked tekken can go fuck itself  Worst experience of my life ill see you tomorrow u fuck
Video soon.
"Which Evangelion Angel is your favorite?  Its a hard call, ramiel is dope as fuck, but my vote has to go to this one:"
"Live! Practicing Fox, making a Sheik matchup chart, and talking about why I'm no longer a solo main. mini subgoal to continue the tekken ranked torture..."
good content bad mental health
playing tekken online was exactly what I thought it would be
Live :(
playing Tekken 7  Online Ranked and if I don't rank up twice I gift 20 subs  god save me
50 retweets and I'll stream ranked tekken right now as payment for being a lazy streamer the last 2 weeks And if I don't rank up I'll gift subs
For real tho online mid level tekken in bo1/3 is ultra turbo garbage LMAO
I legit think tekken ranked online is a worse for your mental health than ultimate online tournaments.  Complete gimmick fest and everyone runs once you figure them out for one game LMAO  But maybe that makes it a perfect subgoal  üëÄüëÄüëÄ
Fuck the clippers
Early Fall guys with @GARMAKILMA
"Late night fox grind. Been playing too much sheik, time to get back to my favorite fighting game character of all time :)"
tsm babyy
"(i think its fine to rank a game highly despite it being dogshit value to anyone who doesn't live in a city with a local scene btw, its just funny how many people don't even seem to mention netcode)"
i like seeing all these fighting game tier lists but its really obvious who lives in good regions and who doesn't lmao
Fall guys with the boys is fun af  nice lil stream  might be back later but need a break at least
"got a headache, whats the best fixes outside of the obvious (water/ibu)"
super early morning Fall guys with Zain/Mango/Lucky!
Probably canceling stream today or doing a super chill one late... Full court basketball for 3 hours has me spent in a way I thought wasn't possible üòë

So motivated ahhhh. Worst thing about basketball is the recovery time :(

"sheik keeps getting better, but good god my fox needs some warmup, especially getting used to delay 3.  Having a legit secondary will be rough to start with,but I got some time and I should be able tomanage if I was able to be a top level player in 2 games at the same time before"

"Live! Playing Zain today, lets see if the Sheff is ready :) Probably playing other top players after as well, motivated after watching Luka yday LMAO also other things after, maybe fallguys!"
I hate that children have to go to school because now all my basketball courts are taken during the day :(

I am drunk and rewatching Anohana and it is glorious
I miss the club bro
No stream I am getting Drunk
"the sheik is getting better and better very quickly, nice grind sessions lately. Still gotta practice more Fox though but I've been on a sheik binge recently. Playing melee in this heat fucking SUUUUCKS tho"
Any top EU players wanna play :)?

Note: I don't think any country is perfect. Its all about what flaws you'd rather live with for most of the good countries.  I can't say america is one of the good ones though.

"KKonas in my twitch chat said today that its not bad to be poor in America, its apparently ""way worse in sweden because its impossible to get out of poverty with the high taxes"".  And I could not say that taxes helped the poor more because I'm not a tax accountant...   lmao"

Playing Melee Before I Am Forced To Play 5 Ultimate Online Tournaments For Twitch Primes Come Hang Out Before My Mental Health Dies
WOW THOUGHT THIS WAS A DEEPLEFFEN TWEET
Lmao Nintendo does it again
do you guys ever think about the fact that its deepleffen who is a literal bot made up from my tweets and not the other way around? i mean the bot seems to have more fucking braincells than people who think this shit is funny but still.
"people think that playing Fox is hard on your body, but yesterday i played basketball in common projects and jeans and now I'm convinced that human bodies are not built properly and that the NBA is all a hoax and not real"
"Thanks to the Memory foam padding and Lightweight design, the @LogitechGesport PRO X Wireless will keep you comfortable for over 8 hours of smash grinding!  That comes out to a whopping 2000 Melee matches, or three and a half Sonic mirrors if you‚Äôre more into Ultimate!"
"Probably not streaming today, hanging with some friends and got some off stream work to do tonight!  I shall keep tabs on the playoffs however"
lmao
what the hell did I just watch @ZainNaghmi
I've made a Huge Mistake Specatatin Melee/Ultimate online tournaments to mentally prepare myself for the hell that's to come (entering 5 online tournaments at 3k subs)
oh no
What have I done
"justintime101, GD_Cade, meda109 and Misterfluffers i do appreciate your suppFUCK YOUJ"
...thank you shoeroo for the prime and wanting me to suffer...
...thank you Dustueue for the tier 1...

thank you neekopls69 for the prime
thank you brutalaxeman for the prime
oilers i am waiting
also I want some new clothes for my post corona timeskip character design
if I reach 3000 subscribers I will stream myself entering 5 Ultimate online tournaments in full because I hate myself
A new fighting game announcment show admitted that online will stay shit?  Its a perfect time to watch this one hour video by yours truly which ranks every fighting game &amp; explains why they suck and what they do well. RT if you want more long form content!
"Won Battle of the Armada 2 with Sheik only! Beat Trif 3-0 WF and 3-1 GF Happy my secondary is already better than EU :)  Huge shoutouts to everyone that entered, and @ArmadaUGS  for hosting!  Will be donating my first place winnings towards a charity for the Beirut Explosion :)"
Playing Trif in winner finals All sheik!
Playing Top 16 now! the SHEFF vs Rikzz
Live! Playing in Armada's tournament HUGE Stacked EU tournament!
practicing my ojou-sama laugh
Adding more custom music to melee! $2 dono/sub and chat will vote on if it should be in! Heres the current list :)
any EU top players who wanna grind?
"Live! Got a big Melee tournament tomorrow, so going to be running sets against top EU players all day today! HMU if you wanna play oh and going all sheik :)"
"ate too much food today, i cannot fit inside of a twitch stream so I'll be back tomorrow thank you for understanding"
big melee/variety streams coming this week my body needs a break from basketball so I gotta fill the void with some sweet sweet internet videogaming
"Live! Entering a big tournament this weekend, and going all sheik, so practicing :) Message me EU players if you wanna run sets!"
"People call melee unbalanced, yet here is a video of an absolute lad winning a tournament in 2020 using all random!!"
"trying new characters in tekken, first up is Zafina!"
getting my first win in fallguys with @GARMAKILMA  melee/umvc3/tekken or something after!
i thought there'd be like a match or two a week LMAO
I didn't realize that there would be good nba literally every single day I can't handle this
"LMAO don't take this tweet too seriously, just real tired of the smash 4 community being bitchass twitter fiends who follow and subtweet me all day then run the second I reply :)"
the amount of subtweeters from the smash 4 community who mute when confronted finally makes me understand the type of person who would play such a defensive dumpsterfire of a game tbh
"for everyone that called the crossup ""cheating"" LMAO"
"also don't do this at home, I don't play tekken but this obviously doesn't do anything to help you win Evos.   picking the latest DLC will do that for you"
"I'm not sure how anyone could think that I'd be that much better with a crossup, considering it was the first time ever practicing on digital inputs. Had top level execution for 7 years on stick lmao  Full video here in case you think the video is cut:"
"People said I could only learn Taunt jet upper with the Crossup, people called it ""tool assisted"" and ""immoral"" and ""cheating"" to do it.  So I once again decided to own the tekken stans and learn it on stick. This time I did it twice within 3 minutes. Do not doubt the gamer genes"
uploading....
ok brb
(who think I can only do it on crossup)
10 retweets and i'll record learning taunt jet upper on stick to prove the haters wrong
"I actually really like core tekken now, I just dislike the online and the bloating of moves and inaccessibility of everything. Playing 1v1 vs a friend offline is really fun. I wouldn't wanna compete in a game that adds leeroy or fahk, but that's another story :)"
"Me: ""melee is wayyy harder than tekken execution wise, but the difficulty of the game does not decide how good a game is. That's not why I like melee or why I dislike some of tekken""  tekken reddit:"
"Tekken is fun to fuck around with :) Might do some more. Tekken jims are the worst though, taking everything out of context and posting on the reddit lmao. Awful online community still.  Marvel 3 is fucking amazingly fun to fuck around with, and the community is sick. More soon."
"It is harder with a tradional stick, depending on how lose/tight it is. But unless y'all ban every other input method, why the fuck should people be forced to use the worst way (execution wise, i also prefer stick feel) to play the game üò¥"
"tekken randoms are always the funniest Calling the cross up ""tool assisted"" LMaoOOOOO  i literally did it with only the directional inputs too, any keyboard or dualshow can do the same by clawing lol  (Also I can do it with stick too, just not as consistently)"
"Chat thought itd take me hours to learn Taunt jet upper in Tekken, said it was ""a huge mistake"" to do it for only 5 subs. It took ""hours"" for *Tekken players*, so itd obv take days for a smasher  Did that shit in 6 minutes...  Dont you ever doubt my gamer genes"
"Live! Also talking about the online changes now that theyre confirmed, and maybe playing Tekken after?"
"IMO its cheating to have a massive FOV advantage, but I do see the value in using it for the stream and such though, which is why I think its fine to allow since most online tournaments arent for big $"
"real talk: playing widescreen melee gives a signficant advantage over people who use regular camera.  I don't really know if I want it to be banned for online tournaments lol, but I do think its worth to keep in mind - imo you'll suffer hard for offline tournaments."
New YT video! My thoughts on how Small Battlefield changes the meta:
What the fuck is this match
"If I'm wrong or just ""farming impressions"", why are y'all acting so hurt.  You can tell me how I'm lazy however much you want, and I wouldn't blink, because I know its not true. üòå"
if ult players spent as much time actually practicing to prove me wrong instead of subtweeting me every 5 minutes about how i am so wrong then maybe yall would actually be winning shit
so much NBA to watch too!
played 4 hours in 29 degrees celsius never knew my body had this much sweat in it  time to order a pizza and DIRTY BUUUUUULKkkk
basket ball
There was a front page post about two people playing offline ultimate today... like come the fuck on thats how rare it is
"Ya bro I have this crazy agenda that ultimate players don't practice much, wew its almost like there's daily proof of most top players doing fuck all on twitch every single day for almost two years. but yeah just an agenda that the players themselves often admit to lol"
"(in case you don't remember, he tweeted that i was stupid to expect ultimate to have matches in sweden, because its a dead region, compared it to south africa)  Of course ran after that too"
Remember when I said to @ me bitch? Biiiiiiiiiiitch.
Getting so much better in melee aaaaa Gonna be hitting up top players soon!
Late night Melee :)
Playing fallguys with @GARMAKILMA and @zaik_ssbm  squad stream as well :) TIME TO GET MY FIRST WIN

why was the 5th episode of god of highschool so great goddamn

best part about playing basketball is that I can eat tons of food everyday with no guilt  worst part is that I have to eat tons of food everyday or i will die

New YouTube video about the new patch!
"What does this even change? Like I know fps run tickrate for their servers, did ultimate run from servers??"
Can someone explain why the hell a fighting game would run 30 tickrate?????
"After trying the patch, does the online connections:"
IVYSAUR BROKEN NEW PATCH NERF NOW?
Live now:
New Ultimate patch out now? New stage? ONLINE FIX? 50 RTs and I'll fuckin boot up and go stream it right now
Its perfect for games that are already more or less dead (where you need discord to find matches) and for games like tekken where the online lobby system is insanely bad. Haven't tested it over far distances yet tho. If only Ultimate had this... ;)
"Tried playing fighting games with Parsec for the first time... It was a looot better than usual, way less stutters. Still a bit of a pain to setup and play people with.  Next I'll try a cloud server, does it have any benefit outside of both having equal delay?"
"playing fate unlimited codes, trying out parsec"

Dragon Ball Fighterz is a bad fun game bad meh ?? good?

"If you livestream from your phone/computer, whats the easiest way to use a wireless mic? Can you use a wireless mic with your phone from say a bluetooth headset?"

If you don't pick red I now have zero faith in you as a person
Thank you @Fizzi36
I love fighting games but dear god do I wish I liked another genre instead sometimes
Developers that don't prioritize people. being able to play their games without wanting to die can go fuck themselves tbh tbh
"Bought the beta bundle, excited to try this out on stream as soon as possible! Controllers are the last big thing that needs to be figured out for melee imo, so gonna be interesting to try out."
Gonna take today off to spend some time with friends :) I'll cya guys tomorrow!

Live now. Ranking every fighting game and explaining why they suck
If this tweet gets 50 Retweets then I will rank every relevant fighting game in 2020 and explain why they suck and what (if anything) they did well.  u got 10 minutes.
"Honestly, every big fighting game kinda sucked this generation. Some games were better than others, but most had great ideas held back by different terrible things that can't really be fixed in a patch or with another dlc character. Still waiting for an amazing fighting game tbh."
"For the fighting game announcement roundtable, I really hope there's minimal character reveals and instead showing trailers for the next generation of fighting games.  This generation of fighting games is so old now, give me new games with better engines and good online."

hi i like melee and basketball

come watch me be a brutally honest coach
Oh my god why did I do this to myself I am going to Explode
BroOooOOoOoo
"Online random: ""nice shot"" = you are so fucking bad, how could you possibly miss that, you absolute donkey. YOU ALONE are the reason I am stuck here in this shit elo.  Irl random: ""nice shot"" = wow that was a genuinely good shot.  Takes a while to get used to LOL"
Playing with randoms online is always a miserable experience of toxicity and depression. Hatred grows every second you spend with them.  Playing basketball with randoms?  Always a fun experience &amp; you end up homies by the end of the session.  Its nice being William sometimes :)
slippi stats that SWEET SWEET 1.5 Openings per kill
"lil jv5  last stock is something i've theorycrafted for a long time, happy it works :))"
Another Late nighter Melee. Maybe getting Ironman wr back :)?
Why is running so awful But running after ball so pog
"And a good wavedash to make use of.  Falcos shine has slightly less range.  Every character, including fox would rather have falco shine. And every character would have a 1 frame insta kill than a 1 frame move that does 5%."
"Shines Fox shine doesn't combo on the lighter half, or on chars that slide too far, doesnt combo people close to the edge or on platforms, less damage, less shield stun (shinegrab for example is much worse), needs a preemptive hitconfirm, can be smash DId, needs fast jump squat."
Some days I wonder if if people who think Fox shine is better than Falco shine or Puff Rest should be allowed to use twitter

"Guys, we get it. Melee is got rollback while you had to wait months for byleth, and then another 6 for min min. you played em for an hour and got bored, and your character got buffed but you still suck and hate playing the game online. But don't take it out on Melee :)"
"Ah yes, that's what everyone hates about ultimate... The, uh, *checks notes*, teleporting glitches that DID exist in ultimate and no one ever complained about before they patched it... Not the online, the buffer, or world of light. Yup, just hateful melee elitists hating."
"Had world record pace on Dr Mario (last char), but got stream sniped and rolled Dreamland =( the road continues."

If this really is a sweden thing (BIG doubt) then I have never been more proud over my country. We don't accept garbage online. Go Sweden fuck yeah!
The best selling fighting game of all time lads.
"some more info. Default MTU, 100up/down, good NAT type (A). Region Europe/English.  Legit not even top 1%, barely ranked top 100000 and still can't find matches. Only battle arena open now that I checked was FFA with items. 20 million copies sold."
"I'm not sure if its cuz it region locks Swedes to only queue with other swedes, but I doubt it. The player I faced was from Finland. Either way its terrible."
"The Ultimate Speedrun Since this clip went ""viral"" - let me clarify. This is not high Elo, it's a fresh account with like 4 characters barely in Elite. It was 9PM on a Friday, aka peak hours. There was one battle arena open, and they left when I joined. Ultimate is so dead."
Anyone got a recommendation for a good ring light or softbox? I have two elgato keylights but it gives way too harsh of a light on me
"Thanks everyone for supporting the charity stream! Hit $4000 so far, going to continue later this weekend with Subspace for charity!"
Someone make a slippi thing or a livesplit thing that automatically cuts queue times for speedruns pls
"Charity stream is live! All donations go towards @RAINN , matching up to $1500! Goals include playing Elite smash (ugh), Subspace emissary playthru &amp; more! Starting off with some Melee Ironman runs!   Please RT!"

Ultimates intro is a D tier btw
"Had a really fun stream today ranking the best fighting game intros - a well needed reminder why I do what I do. Going to be voting for the best intro tomorrow, stay tuned :)"
Deleted last tweet because I'm not gonna let that awful human being ruin my mentions or my day Good night :)
"why are you guys friends with so many people that you don't think would pay you back?  I agree that you should be responsible with your money, and know that it is a risk that you won't get it back, but this is seriously some fucked up logic in order to blame the victims tbh"
"I really wanna find a way to move forward from this, not be in some awkward limbo between one twitlonger and the next. Going to talk about it on stream, probably uploading it to youtube and recapping everything thats happened a bit."
I can't fucking wait until I can play basketball again.
"It's also so hard to stream while all of this is happening and coming out in real time, and I'm sure I've said many stupid things and influenced people in the wrong way. I will do better and wait more.  Sorry for rambling, I've just had a lot on my mind and had to say something."
"I think it still hasn't hit me fully and I certainly haven't dealt with it properly either. I wasn't close enough to call them great friends, but I partied, hung out and ate dinners with these predators and liars.The question of both what I could and can do better is still there."
"that I'm only succeeding because the other people got banned, not because I'm doing a better job, at least that's how it feels. It's again, the caveman competitor in me I think.   I think its just an side effect of all these people I knew using their positions to do awful things."
"That said I will be doing charity streams and donating a large amount of the money I have made recently, both because its the right thing to do and to clear my own conscience honestly.  Sadly it'll forever be etched into my mind that any success going forward is ""tainted""-"
"I try to set myself straight by remembering that I know I didn't do any of the tweets or videos I did for clout, but I still can't seem to quite convince myself yet.  I need to realize that I knew the majority of people in these allegations, and that its natural to feel this way."
"It's honestly been really hard to deal with the fact that I've been getting a ton of followers/subscribers during this week. My caveman brain can't help but be happy when I see the numbers go up, and at the same time I can't stop feeling insanely guilty for it."
Honestly I'm still really down about the fact that we can't play copyrighted music anymore on stream. Sharing music and listening to suggested songs/albums were one of my favorite things about streaming and its something that I'll miss very very much.
back from the hospital chill stream thoughts on current stuff later maybe
"If you want to show support, do not show it to a guy who's already making a good living by competing and streaming. Show it to the people who are still out there fighting for their right to even attend tournaments harassment free, and those who just want their voice heard."
"For me, I want to take a slight step back because I do not want anyone to get an impression that this is my personal crusade or anything, which I've sadly had to repeatedly tell people who come into my chat and call me a ""hero"". This isnt about me, I simply helped others speak up"
"That said, I know its exhausting but now is the time to speak up. How we deal with it is as a whole is much easier to decide when everythings out in the open. There are no tournaments for a while anyway."
"If the behavior takes place at a tournament or is connected to an event, its worth bringing up. You are not a clout chaser just because you bring up something smaller than a felony.  Reminder: Jisu's initial allegations were not on that level, but they led to others speaking up."
"Not going to comment on any particular case, but the people who think no one should speak up and that its a private matter as long as it's not rape or abusing minors, are missing the point. This is a problem in our culture, and simply banning the worst offenders isn't enough."
"by the way I appreciate the intentions but I am not looking for advice, already got plenty thanks :)"
"Part of me was honestly scared it was gonna be cancer, despite knowing how unlikely it was. Been a huge burden to not know for sure so gonna celebrate with a drink or two today ü•≥"
"For people asking what I had done, I had both a gastroscopy and colonoscopy today, and it was pretty fkn rough (most don't feel much but sadly i really did despite pain medication). Had tests done that suggested an inflammatory disease like Chron's but turned to be nothing!"
"My stomach is especially a huge hindrance whenever I travel for tournaments sadly, especially the last 6 months, but I'll find a way to deal with it. I feel bad for everyone with even worse problems :("
"Done with stomach procedures, found nothing but that's a good thing. Means I'll have to live with a shitty stomach forever, but at least I'll get to live with it LMAO"
"Going in for some medical procedures tomorrow (stomach related stuff). Nothing too serious, but I can't eat any solid food and I'll probably be out of social media for a bit. If I stream it'll be cam/micless"
remember the good old times
(and by our I mean the smash community...duh)
I still think everything hasn't hit me yet. This week will definitely be one of the most important weeks in our history. It'll take a long time to process for sure...
"(In general I do not believe in making people ""irredeemable"",  because at that point these people have absolutely no incentive to try and change.)"
"Of course it is much more important to make sure that the survivors are priority #1, but yeah do not be assholes just because you can.   I do still think they are redeemable as humans, but it will take a LONG time and it should NOT happen within the smash community, ever."
"I want to be clear with something.  I understand you are all angry at the people who betrayed everyone's trust, but do not viciously harass them and send death threats to them because of it. Two wrongs do not make a right."
I needed this
"Any comment that I started the rumor about M2K is false. I was streaming and people posted his name in chat, and I posted asking about it. The vod is here and you can check.  Very brave for M2K to go out what he said though, I feel extremely bad for him."
Live. Just playing melee. Nothing else.
"Everyone needs to take this experience, and learn from it.  Do not idolize top players. Do not harass people who are just telling their stories. They are not just ""accusers"" - they are people, individual persons who've had to live through both the trauma itself &amp; the harassment."
"Distancing myself is not because I think that its unclear if what he did was wrong. It was.  It is because I do not want the headlines people like Keemstar bring up to be about ""drama, zero vs leffen!!"".  I'll leave the rest to you guys."
"Zero messaged me just now trying to talk to me privately. I refused, see tweet below.  1. He is not actually taking a break from the internet. 2. This is not about me vs him. This is about what he did to underage girls.  I will be trying to distance myself from this now."
I'm just so mad. Knowing that people will be convinced by these lies from Zero.  Sorry but I'm not sure how to deal with this properly still.
"The entire response, making this all by himself while lying and without adressing many of the serious allegations, is incredibly manipulative and to me proves he still isn't sorry he did it, just sorry he got caught.  Absolutely disgusted to have considered him my friend."
Zero is straight up lying in his new statement. Wait for further responses.
This was sent to me regarding Zero's First allegation. CW: NSFW(Censored)
Live. Talking about Everything... day 3. Lots I want to say still.
"why do you people always, and i mean ALWAYS, have an anime fucking profile picture of fucking dbs super no less"
"this was posted in response to her twitlonger, its fucking insane the mental gymnastics people go to."
"you are not being slick with thinking that zero's allegations were completely disproven despite him saying he doesn't remember and unrelated flight receipts and messenger logs, yet you fucking go ""what about the jpeg artifacts"" when presented with hard screenshots?"
"The way Zero's fanbase is defending him, regardless if you think hes innocent or not, is honestly disgusting. He literally told you guys not to harass the victims and yet they still do it in droves."
"I agree. I don't think people ment it that way, but its the unfortunate reality of what it does IMO"
"Seems like this day will be just as tough to stomach as the last. Definitely going to take some time to process this, most likely taking a break from streaming at least."
This was written before this came out. Reading now.
"again, I am NOT trying to say that anyone should be canceled, or anything of that sort. Just offering my take on a very nuanced and complicated situation."
My thoughts about Jisu/Zero. It's simply a long nuanced post with some more info  Read:
"What a fucking day. Thanks for listening to me, but more importantly keep listening to the people that are brave enough to come forward. Going to take a break from social media for a while, take care &lt;3"
"Put up a video on my youtube about the recent allegations within the smash community. Obviously not monitized. Not edited, or scripted, just a segment from my stream today that I felt I needed to share."
Live. We need to talk. Trolls/spammers will be permabanned.
"Was planning on streaming an offline ultimate session today, but before I start with that I'll start the stream out by adressing everything thats been happening. Starting in about two hours."
What the fuck. So fucking disgusted.
Talking about everything thats been going on. Ult8.0/Min min lab &amp; impressions and Melee after.
"&amp; the potential abuse it allows against these young community members.  I should've known better and going forward I will make sure that I much more actively look after and try to support them, and we as a community need to make a change to prevent this from ever happening again."
"As for myself, I've always tried to be on the lookout for sexual harassment and other inappropriate behavior, but coming from a relatively older scenes (Melee/FGC) I never quite realized how much younger the scene was in Ult and the risks that come with the age differences -"
"Its important to remind yourself and others that people speaking up is a positive - this stuff was always happening, even if you didn't know.  Proud of everyone who has spoken up, and I hope people see how huge of a problem this is within our community."
"Ankle is healing slowly but surely... Can't wait to play basketball again, but I'm gonna force myself to take it slow :("
New youtube video! Breaking down Minmin and my thoughts on her and how good she is!
no one is stopping you casuals from playing on it.
"read this thread LMAOOO ""You owe us a new stage"" aka ME AS A VIEWER DEMAND THAT YOU PLAY ON SHITTY STAGES FOR MY ENTERTAINMENT"
"oh and the patch changes were really cool overall, outside of not having any bugfixes/online fixes etc"
long fun stream! my findings: minmin is fun ultimate online is even worse than I could remember it and basically dead in my region (took 10min on patch day to get a match...) ultimate training mode is literal garbage  slippi got a new patch and melee got even better good night :)
"Minmin walkthrough/guide, then going through the latest Slippi patch!"
For all the people who have now tried melee netplay and went back to Ultimate with Minmin - do you see now how fucking awful online is?
"if you legit think that spring stadium should be legal despite having a fucking ceiling you're an absolute moron - like, you're almost as stupid as the people who think online is gonna get fixed"
honestly minmin is just byleth on some fucking crack i don't know why you gave a character half screen pokes that combo and are safe on shield and jump cancelable LMFAO
seems fun tho
min min is a campy campy bitch bitch
THE LEFF RETURN TO ULTIMATE Half an hour for Minmin man with no legs tries to use ARMS 8.0 patch get ready for one low tier to get one move knockback changed
"Thirty minutes in and its just obvious Minmin needs needs buffs and bugfixes, it's honestly so sad to see yet another campy character with a lack of movement and combos get released. Her multihits don't even work either, its insane how Sakurai keeps fucking this up!"
idk why there's a fox outside of my apartment but I fuck with it
My main fox came to bless me during these tough times  (i think hes making sure I don't play too much elite smash)
Whens minminmin
We need to do a better job to protect those in danger of being abused in our community. Period. I can only hope more people feel like they will be heard if they speak up now but it shouldn't take a movement for something like this to be brought to light. We gotta do something.
"Fucking crazy seeing people you thought you knew come out with shit like this. Not sure what to say.   Saddest thing is knowing that it's not something unique, this happens far more often than it should and in the majority of cases people do not speak up. Fucking hell."
Stream is BACK Ankle completely fucked Subgoal to show on stream LMAO come chill with some degen melee
dont laugh at my stupid ass face ok ty!
"Here's a link to a google doc I compiled with common Q&amp;A's for Slippi/Rollback melee, such as what monitor to buy, how to play it offline and more  (incase you don't want to watch the video I made for it :&gt;)"
"New video up! This one goes through the massive impact Slippi/Rollback Melee has had, what future updates are planned (such as Ranked) and a big google doc that answers a ton of common questions :)"
"Obviously there's a lot of nuance and such, but at the end of it all - it really isn't that hard to be a decent ass human being. We're not talking about being a perfect outstanding person 24/7, just be decent, especially when you're in a position of power over others."
"I'm so proud of the victim's that have been speaking out lately, especially seeing how much abuse they get online because theyre threatening to endanger some neckbeards favorite eceleb/entertainment.  I want to talk more about it on stream but I felt like I needed get this out."
For this weeks streams I'm legit gonna have to setup a way to stream while lying down and having my foot elevated... Lol
"Doing literally anything with this ankle sprain is such an insane challenge, I can't put any significant weight on it at all. Going to the bathroom is a fucking adventure lmao. Thank god this didn't happen during tournament season, definitely would've missed a ton"
I think its going to be very fun when ranked comes out
"New people getting into melee is fucking awesome, but I can already tell the increase in people Dunning Krugering out of their god damn mind is going to be ROUGH"
Thank god I have rollback melee. Honestly don't know what I'd do the next month without it.
I'll probably be fine eventually but I'm honestly feeling down so I'm gonna take a bit to mentally reset before I stream and such. Hope y'all understand.
"No stream today and maybe tomorrow, pretty fucking sad and obviously in pain. Basketball was one of the few things keeping me sane this year with all my stomach problems (yes im seeing doctors) and this is probably gonna keep me from playing for most of this summer. Fuck."
"home and icing, ill come back from this eventually :(  fuck anyone making fun of people in serious pain. Go fuck yourself"
"Landed badly in basketball, hurt ankle real bad and now my ankle is super omega swollen :( hopefully its not broken"
short short haired melee stream  before i go BALL new ball emote up btw
"Haircut time, rip hair"
"Doing Rollback Q&amp;A, talking upcoming features, bugfixes, how to get widescreen Melee/hd textures and more!"
"Streaming!  Doing a Rollback Q&amp;A, and making a guide on how to get into Melee for Ult players! also Ironmans ;)"
getting my pony dragon ready for evo and talking anime and eating food
IRONMAN !ROLLBACK - How to get into melee guide later and Rollback Q&amp;A later!
"5 hours of bball, 5 hours of melee ya boi is LEVELING UP"
"rollback melee is giving me the best practice, i can't believe this is just every day now - feels like I'm at a bootcamp and that its going to go away in two days LOL"
Live! super chill ROLLBACK SCHMELEE planning a video on how to get into melee as an Ult player &amp; talking new controllers
why don't i know anything about a panda controller..  Is it the basketball tweets?  üò≠
I love the new matchmaking system ü§ó
fun times today! stream and iron man runs continue tomorrow :)
"Live!  More Rollback melee, teaching new/ult players how to play, IRONMANS, and watching the new GG Strive footage with Millia + Zato! also got a special delivery from @Hit_Box ;)"
"The game isn't coming out until 2021, just take your time and show things off when they're ready, instead of ruining people's first impression of the game."
"I feel like for new players, the first thing people will catch on to is the characters personality and playstyle. Granblue trailers while not perfect did a MUCH better job of this, making a lot of people go ""I wanna be a X main"" before they even knew if they liked the game."
"They both look really cool, amazingly well animated, but this is yet another case where Arcsys is dropping the ball marketing wise. Even outside of the underwhelming production value and lack of voice acting, this trailer tells you NOTHING about the characters for casuals."
"Getting sun/exercise/food, I'll be live later tonight though!"
melee.jpg
"Watching so many new people try melee makes me really happy :)  Its gonna be rough as fuck for a while, but if you keep at it, trust me, you'll get that moment where everything aligns and you'll be hooked for life"
best day in a long time ill be back tomorrow with more melee :)
Playing @ZainNaghmi  110 PING BUTTERY SMOOTH ROLLBACK

"Watching Game Awards, announcement soon"
The direct honestly made me miss eating ramen with friends more than playing ultimate
Happy its not Spring man tbh cool trailer hopefully the stage is legal with hazards off Disappointing that there's no online changes... again... but at least there's sprit board stuff! wow! countless hours of fun content!!
"LIVE! Arms DLC announcement starting soon, then Crash 4 announcment (smash dlc?) and then HUGE announcment of my own :) #0"
#0
"Going to sleep, fun stream :) I'll be live about an hour or so before the Arms reveal in 10ish hours from now, and I've also got a big announcement lined up for tomorrow after the Direct :) Cya then!"
"ARMS FACT #3 Biff, the announcer, is actually a literal god within the universe. He appears to have no memory of this however. It is theorized by experts of the Arms lore that he has acheived ARMS level 2, as he not only has spring arms, but grown a third arm out of his head."
"ARMS FACT #2 Did you know, Spring mans ICONIC Toothpaste hair is actually not his real hair, but a HAT? Some people really believe that Arms and the ARMS(TM) league is a shallow game/society, but its not true at all. You can tell Sakurai thought about this when choosing the DLC!"
"ARMS FACT #1 Did you know, Spring man is not his actual name, it is a title that you earn? Spring man's real name is actually Robert."
Checkout my new sick profile picture! Can't wait for what Masahiro Sakurai has planned for us!! SPRING MAN GONNA GET YOU #ARMS #LEGS
"Big stream live! Talking about the extremely exciting ARMS DLC &amp; Ultimate 8.00 patch wishlist, watching Octagon matches from yesterday, and talking online/netplay problems!"
"Sorry guys, no battle of the Armada for me. Some stuff came up, coupled with needing some time off to relax.  I'll make it up to you guys :)"
"Idk how anyone looks at results from the Rage tournament and say ""FERRY NEEDS NERFS"" lmao, y'all are being reactionary as fuck."
Booo
Its time
ok its super fucking late but its finally time how to ACTUALLY #fixultimateonline yes there is a way starting now
"Live!  starting with melee, then Ultimate talk in a bit come tell me what character to use for Online tournaments!"
almost forgot to sign up üòÖ  now to decide what character to play...üôÉ
Its 6pm my time don't judge me I streamed to 8am
best way to start the day üôè
I wonder when its gonna start affecting @DeepLeffen LMAO
I'm trying really hard to think of a tweet that doesn't include basketball but I can't
"too tired to do a stream today, sorry :("
how do I stop bssketball from taking over my life my body needs rest and I need to stream but I can't stop ballin
"""I'm an e-hooligan ready to take your ass to the blastzone"" LMAO"
great day :)
"Live! Going to talk about how to really #FixUltimateOnline  and then watch videos about Ultimate/smash/whatever for a bit, then maybe Valorant comeback?"
"Basketball solo practice went well today after a few days of recovery, 3 point and drive-layup practice tomorrow :))"
11d61c3b  open again bo5
"Spent all day recording YT videos. Reading from a script is so much harder for me than streaming, but I think I got better at it. Expect much more YT content soon, subscribe etc :)"
"working on big youtube stuff for this week atm, ill stream once im finished. Super hyped :)"
big brunch tacos
follow my instagram for pics if they can even fit me anymore
had my first protein shake brb getting HUGE
the ending to the midorima match where midorima goes on a full on 2 minute speech in the last 3 seconds of the match only to pump fake a shot into getting yoinked by kuroko because he knew kagami would jump when he couldnt jump LMAOAOOAOAOAO
been rewatching kuroko no basket since y'know   its a show thats really silly and stupid but sometimes - sometimes it manages to be so stupidly hype lmao  i love me a good ending transition
"I can't be the only one who completely forgot that there's supposed to be an Arms DLC character reveal in June?   Don't think I've ever been less hyped for a DLC yet, hopefully it comes with a thick ass 8.0 patch"

Drunk boy thinking about Japan
"stream tonight, but first üèÄüèÄüèÄüèÄ"
Live! listening to some new COPYRIGHT FREE music
"Not being able to play music during streams sucks so bad :( we need specific permissions from  labels/artists now? Really hope something changes soon. Until then, if you have good copyright free music lists or if you own your music and want me to check it out, link it below!"
how long until you stop being sore 24/7 tho My legs are killing me
"Finally had a breakthrough in results for basketball after a bit of a plateau the last few games, figuring out more and more how to nail the shooting form :))  Next up is layups once my body has recovered... I love grinding shit lmao"
Really fun stream :)
big boy sore but im trying to stream tonight... stay tuned
"one more is not a mere saying, its a lifestyle üèÄüèÄüèÄüèÄüêêüòåü§ó"

whenever its my turn on the party jukebox
Basketball boys
Saturday is for the boys
"very lucky to have people follow and watch me even while I manically switch games and interests all the time, be it ultimate, granblue, melee or basketball.  wouldn't trade this freedom for any amount of money :)"
"having a good time streaming melee lately :) variety streams will definitely return though, but chill ass melee while interacting with the chat is the reason I started streaming - i never planned on making this a career. and sometimes I need to remember that"
:(
Why sweden sucks at basketball:
"im going to do a charity stream for BLM where I will enter an online ultimate tournament and play elite smash for donations  and i donate $10 for every time i complain  got some stuff to sort out though, so maybe sundayish"

Big Bulking Billiam Bractices Bheik Because Boring Barth Box Batchup Blows  (melee stream)
got some really cool stuff in the works üòå
Big Bulking Billiam coming thru
"Live! Melee practice stream, talking Valorant, Basketball and BULKING to become the biggest leff there ever was"
"Not going crazy or anything, just small additions to make my body take the basketballing and not traveling to america calorie defecit"
Give me your best healthy weight gain foods (i guess its called bulking lmao)
finally figuring out my shooting form and left ball handling a bit better. Half an hour turned into two hours woops.  now its time to learn to eat more/better :(
fuck this ima go BALL
Valorant without competitive is one of the most boring things I've ever played.
"Live! Valorant Launch hype - melee later :) trying out the new modes, new agent Reyna etc"
My feet hurt bad :( fkn concrete
"the competitive aspect is 100% working to get me to be more fit though, I could never go this long with running etc. Just gotta stop it from taking over too much lmao"
basketball makes muscles i didn't know I had sore  gotta stop playing for 3+ hours everytime and pace myself better
You never know what a person really thinks about you or your playstyle until you smurf them
"Getting ready for online tournaments Melee practice &amp; chill talking valorant, basketball :)"
(referring to solo q))
Its so fun being able to consistently lose in something thats not team based
"day two of basketball, shooting still sucko, but got some 2v2 in and had much better stamina in  Gotta find a hoop to practice on &gt;:("
playing pony game
fuckin love how no one can respond LMAO
melee is the best
"Melee practice, talking Valorant, Basketball, BLM... come chill and hang out"
"Melee stream later tonight Also reviewing my time with valorant, and talking basketball lmao"
"it feels wrong to write this too, because obviously I'm not against people donating or helping, and of course I understand worrying about offending people and your bottom line, but I just know that we gotta do better.  There are fucking human lives at stake."
I just want people to know that this takes more than just a print screened donation message if we truly want change. Its daily action - I see far too many of my colleagues in streaming for example who are afraid to speak up or ban people because they worry about their bottom line
"I wish I could say this is just a problem in America, but it isn't. I'm going to find a way to help out tomorrow."
"Been trying so hard to say something that hasn't already been said a thousand times over... but honestly I'm just speechless.  The racists and more notably, the people who don't mind racists or racism simply because ""it doesn't affect me"" is making me lose faith in humanity."
Bro my LEGS
accidentally dribbled in parking lot turned to half hour of handling practice is this the basketball classic
"Headed home now, played for 3ish hours mostly practicing shooting cuz shit stamina, was really fun. I can feel the addiction starting already, the dopamine rush everytime you hear a shot go through the basket üòå solo practice tomorrow, more vs practice sunday :))"
i have such bad stamina fuck me gotta work on that
labbin some hot new tech
I wish I could stream learning basketball in a convenient manner LMAO
anyone got basketball newbie learning resources? I got a ball now and basically 0 exp I remember (i know the rules) lmao
i was the blueprint for a twitter bot
"woke up from a nightmare, turned to twitter and yeahhh...  stay safe everyone :( jfc."
im so bleh in melee rn whos tryna help me get back in shape?
"played tennis while younger, just not sure how to get back into it. maybe once courts open up ill find someone to play vs"
this summer i wanna get into a sport  im going to funnel my addiction for competition to live a more physically active life lmao. basketball is my first thing to try.
"Ill prob make a video on it eventually. Going to take a lil break from streaming today &amp; tomorrow and finish up some paperwork I've been putting off, then returning with valorant review and melee/fgs grind."
"Learning another team game has been a fun/awful experience - it really makes me appreciate smaller formats such as 1v1/2v2 where its easier to get proper practice, where you don't have to rely on random solo q monkeys who are just playing to kill time. Still a good learning exp."
"still alright considering 0 minutes of CS exp and only 1 season of genji as FPS exp really, but still. I could've been much better and I need to go back and figure out how I can improve even faster."
"inb4 ""rank doesn't matter cuz x"" bro if ur gonna be like that, nothing fucking """"matters"""" - we're all gonna die and no one will remember us in a few hundred years. Putting time into something and failing is okay to be upset over. I know that caring is exactly why I can be great"
"Ended Valorant in Plat 2, didnt reach my goal of Diamond =(  pretty disappointed in myself tbh, sucks to not reach your goals even if it largely feels it was due to solo que being high variance.  i'll be much better once ranked comes back -_-"
"Live! Last Valorant stream for a while, maybe ever Last chance to get Diamond streaming all fucking day grinding lets go"
i played melee im happier now
this is all a test by god every micless russian every jetpicker every french person who flames everyone in french every fucking swede who flames in the worst english accent possible all these fucking monkeys will not bring me down i will persevere  (maybe)

fate unlimted codes is such a sick fucking fighting game holy shit
Its time Naruto GNT 4
"First time trying Skullgirls - FG Marathon! Tekken - Fate/UC, THEMS FIGHTING HERDS &amp; More!"
THEY'S *
WHAT. WERE. THEY. THINKING.
"The most impressive part of Them's Fightin' Herds isn't the good gameplay, or netcode-it's that its manages to have the single worst title for a fighting game ever, and that's been a race to the bottom for YEARS. I didn't think Under Night In-Birth Exe:Late[cl-r] could be topped"
"Its TIME Trying the Fate fighting game, Fate/Unlimited Codes"
"Live now with the FIGHTING GAME MARATHON! During today and tomorrow me and @zaik_ssbm are going to be playing a ton of differing games, starting off by learning Them's Fightin' Herds,with Skullgirls, Melty, Tekken &amp; more lined up!"
which version of Fate Unlimited codes is the best one to play? PSP or PS2 also any guides on how to make it work with 2p etc üëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄ
apparantly i missed the sales by mere minutes F
what version of skullgirls do I buy
"trying to make it through tower of god but man its so meh looking, the ost is good at times but used so weirdly, and outside of a cool world it really is outstandingly mediocre for now. hope last eps improve on that."
"Note: do not confuse people who can't explain what they did to get good with people who didn't work hard - many people are just not very articulate/introspective and to them their good hard working habits are so ingrained that they're ""natural"".  Anyway this should be a video."
"To some people that is proof that ""talent"" is a big deciding factor, but honestly, who does well like that proves nothing except who is the best when almost noone practices hard or properly. It isn't really indicative of top level, or rather, mastery level competition, at all."
"although talent is not whats stopping 99,9% people in esports, many who get to a high level in less competitive scenes often get there intitally because of ""luck""- they simply mindlessly played the game a lot and then happened to get good, rather than deliberately practicing."
"Very often, good results in the beginning (without very hard work) mean: 1. The person is focused on winning short term, abusing one or two strategies only and not learning things fully or thoroughly. 2. The person does not learn how to value hard work, and what habits you need ."
"I think the funniest thing about the talent vs hard work debate is how little people have read and looked into the subject, yet they're 100% certain one way.  Biggest misconception imo is that the only thing people think is ""talent"" is learning things quickly in the beginning."
i need to listen to music more when im feeling down
Suggest me and Zaik games to play :)
"today I got the last laugh over Valorant! getting a ton better now, game sense/aim has improved but most importantly getting better at being resilient in solo q and more productive comm wise in stacks.  Break from Valo for 2 days, streaming Fighting game marathon tomorrow!"
"Melee players break their hands practicing double shines 5 hours a day and think ""melee is just talent and who you know"".  Fgc players don't warm up or play casuals and dodge me online every day  Woop woop"
Most Ultimate top 100 players never grind the game even a tenth of what most esport pros do and then sit and whine about talent yup sounds about right
getting revenge on valorant
fuck valorant today ill see you tomorrow you little fuck

Today is the day  getting Diamond in Valorant Long grind stream lets go
"I will stream fighting games soon i swear, just been really enjoying the improvement/team game grind from Valorant. Once I hit diamond streams are back to mostly FGs!"
I played very well in Valorant Solo Que Today :) tomorrow we are getting diamond.
watched the last dance ep now im ultra motivated to get diamond in valorant melee practice later tonight!
bro episode 9 of the last dance when the streets 1:12 song comes on... LMAOOOO
Valorant chill grind maybe melee/them fighting herds/ultimate online talk later
"broke: if zain beats u with roy then marth fox is winnable zains just better  woke: a character with almost nothing but marths dashback, grab and dtilt can still beat fox/falco, proving how impossible fox/marth is"
"tldr goodshit @ZainNaghmi , stop dodging me tho :("
"The real dominance isn't even pure melee skill, its that the top players all have way more pressure on them yet still almost never get upsetted, and while everyone in that top also maintain a big online presence through could constant content where many lower just play Melee."
"To be real for a moment, I don't think most people realize just how much better the top 6/7 etc have always been at Melee than even top 20/30/40 even tho the rest never ever win shit.  The work ethic is not even comparable imho"
"I wake up and I see Zain beat a bunch of top players with Roy... Fuck man this really makes me realize, what have I been doing all this time, playing Valorant, Granblue?   ...Mewtwoman will return..."
big sleep
"Taking a day off today, making some dope food and chilling the fk out Cya tomorrow"
Gooood decision
Live! Valorant - HITTING DIAMOND TODAY? (plat 2 atm) 50 subs when I do  then later EVO online talk!
"Evo Onlin e not including Ultimate, SFV, Tekken, DBFZ and all the other games with terrible netcode is such a good thing.  No one is forced to endure awful online in the hopes for an ""EVO title"" AND it puts a ton of pressure for fighting game devs to actually include rollback."
streaming thems fightingg herds and skullgirls soon
i placed in iron btw LOL
"fucking finally (first fps outside of one season of genji, be nice =()"
TODAY IS THE FUCKING DAY PLATINUM in Valorant gifting 50 subs 1 win away
someone please give me a fucking prime i cant even rn
"reading thru the stupid fucking replies to this tweet, ""ur not as famous as dennis rodman you can't complain"" and ""you trash talk, you can't complain"" and YEP, that type of fucking headassery is exactly why I wouldn't do this for free."
also its 6:30 am hi
this scene from the last dance really fucking resonated with me
Live! reading the BIG BOY Valorant patch notes and then hitting plat and gifting 50 subs
Rollback please save me
"Single player games are cool and all but they will never replace competitive games for me. Most feel more like a movie, and if they're genuinely hard instead then I feel like its effort I'd rather spend on honing my craft in fgs."
every day in this fucking quarantine I have to choose to either suffer through the shitty fighting game online hell or playing with toxic children with no mics in valorant
Live! TODAY WE ARE HITTING PLAT in valorant gold 3 atm gifting 50 subs when it happens
lil melee stream derusting and listening to music from secret sky!  also subgoaling/talking european quarantine series

insane remix.
SHINE
the melee samples o lord here we go
oh fuck the japanese house YES
amazing
the intro ohhh shit
i dont know why but the typos made me gasp
avril lavigne what the fuck why does this work so well
#secretskyfest
the kkb edit god damn
only thing worse is the absolute fucking cavemen that play fighting games online on PS4 for a game thats ported to PC   (if you can afford it obv)
meanwhile this is Ultimate players playing on average 15 frame delay with their neighbor and yet think letting people play across the atlantic in wifi tournaments   both of y'all suck
"its honestly so funny to me that melee players act like 0.5 frame delay completely fucks over their gameplay and changes the entire tier list while also not doing trying to make sure they are playing on the right buffer, running 60hz on a 144hz monitor and also run windowed mode"
this shit is siiiick
"today i had trash teammates in valorant but we still ranked up twice lets gooo. The grind is paying of and feels gooood.  Might take tomorrow off tho, or super late stream! I'll let u know"
Live!  new background lights same OLD VALORANT GRIND
guys i know about purple shampoo
left: me after i leave the hair salon right: me two days later
"thank fucking god i don't play teamgames proffessionally lmao, I get sad if I win but play bad &amp; get carried, and I get sad if I lose and play bad, and I get sad if I play well and lose. 3/4 scenarios you feel sad :(  GRIND CONTINUES TOMORROW"
"MVPd 6/8 games today in valorant, and got 2 aces, played better than ever before, ranked down. just team game things"
Valorant grind is live once more! Gifting 40 subs today... because i failed to get plat =( getting plat today tho i swear fr fr #Fixultimateonline talk in a few hours as well!
"hardest thing about learning team games is realizing how insanely luck based any individual game is because of teammates, but how little luck based there is in the long term. tomorrow we try again."
today in valorant i played by far the best ive ever had in a 10 hour session my results? 6-6 and a rank down baybeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Valorant stream is live! Today I'm hitting Plat... from gold 1... or im gifting 40 subs (DOUBLE OR NOTHING) talking nintendo leaks/smash stuff in 1 hourish
"Gold 1 in Valorant now, making steady progress after placing Iron 3! the road continues later tonight or tomorrow, stay tuned :)"
Live! Valorant grind continues today we are hitting plat or I gift 20 subs also reading @DeepLeffen tweets video ASMR subgoal
"Going to talk about it on stream later today, really interesting to see where this goes!"
"Apparently there's been a huge data leak from Nintendo, including lots of source code for games.  With how much the Melee comm has already done by modding it through hacks using Assembly, im sure someone's gonna find the cure to cancer if we get our hands on the Melee source code"
Check DMs @SSB_Swedish @johnny_S2J @C9Mang0 @Wizzrobe !
Long weird day Ended the day by looking through fighting game character selects and fighting game posters/art. Chill and dope af.   Gonna do a day where I rank fighting game openings soon!
smurf drama talk/evo payouts/watching YT vids
"here's what we will do, i'll pay the money today and you'll pickup falcon again like you got thousands of dollars for and everyone will be happy!"
"straight up, haven't got the check myself. My manager @TSMScales can confirm. Couldn't cash the check in sweden because it was too large. My bad for not following up though, straight up procrastinated on it."
"Valorant stream! Streaming with @GARMAKILMA, power couple gonna rock ranked :O Melee chill/drama talk later tonight"
melee stream soon!
played valorant on stream went 0-4 to start with 0 voice coms outside of one guy who dropped the hard R twice  then I played melee off stream and now I have faith in humanity again
"bad PR move to then laugh about it and not make an actual apology, honestly think thats 90% of the reason people are upset. Just own your stupidity and your fuckup and ban yourself from online tournaments for a year to make it right  ur mental health will thank you too."
"smurfing netplay tournaments with 4 people in a tournament with bounties and prizepool and not expecting backlash is really, really fucking stupid. that said i just think they really were just stupid (temporarily) and didn't think how it hurt TOs/other attendees."
Valorant ranked grind continues  Iron -&gt; diamond  currently silver 2!  then maybe some Melee &amp; chill :)
i'll enter an online ultimate tournament at 2k subs btw
"people really sit and call girls who wear low cut tops on twitch ""desperate for attention"", meanwhile youre sitting there, tier 3 subbed to a man willing to subject himself to online Ultimate tournaments for views"
"improving in teamgamed without being toxic is hard as fuck, definitely a roufh learning experience but everyone has to go through it so I just gotta learn with it. Can't wait to see some real ass progress tomorrow!"
"fun stream, omega tilted in placements and got Iron 3 in Valorant, and then climbed up to bronze 3. the journey for diamond/immortal/VALORANT continues tomorrow. some rough games but really enjoying the struggle of trying to get good at something new!  &amp;ty for big host @TSM_Myth"
I can't fucking wait to play EVO Online in Ultimate with 500 frame lag from sweden
"Its finally time! Valorant Ranked grind starts today, lets see what ~15 days of FPS practice will get me!  Placements starting now!"
yo @ZainNaghmi what was the house rule for Coup you guys played with?
"Live again!  Streaming Valorant, checking out the new patch and preparing for Ranked tomorrow!"
Ultimate Online Tournament? 2k subs M I N I M U M
"Online tournaments are both fun and really sad, makes me long for actual fucking tournaments :((  On the other hand, they're amazing stream content, so I think I'll do some more! All kinds of games, tekken, unist, p+ etc u name it and maybe host some myself. Stay tuned :)"
in losers already for the GBVS tournament LMAO  our team had to play a lowain and a zooey in 2-6 frame lag (wifi or extremely bad connection)   feels good to compete again!!!
Live! Playing in an Online Granblue tournament (3v3!) playing Zooey! Then Valorant ranked :D
"At least zooey is fun, and ranked comes out tomorrow! PMA!!"
rough day had a massive headache and just feeling meh healthwise  but tomorrow i shall be stronger
"Granblue time! Learning Zooey for a tournament tomorrow, and checking patch changes to all the top tiers!"
"Live!  Valorant grind, Ranked is tomorrow! New patch notes today, and then Granblue with Zooey grind!"
"fun stream, super excited to grind more zooey tomorrow and delve deeper into the top tier nerfs!  ty for watching, and ty to big @Bjergsen for the big raid :)"
stayed up way too late playing zooey this chars pressure is really good! dragon making overhead a LOT harder to see gives you a lot of mix chances when you combine it with throw combos  and dustloops are so cool  *insert bo5 meme here*
still streaming btw
New granblue patch is great AND zooey is fucking cool as shit. Im so hyped
"Live!  New BIG Granblue patch + New DLC character! Lets try this game out, got a tournament in 2 days!"
when is zooey coming out? and the patch?
Valorant stream is Live!  Granblue patch stream with Zooey later tonight!
"Granblue patch notes are interesting - some nerfs to top tiers, but im unsure about if it matters that much.  Beelzebub got fucking nerfed LOL Will test out and compare between patches as soon as its out!"
Melee is a good game
Watching pound!  WF starting now also eating food  then Valorant later!
"alternatively, whats the easiest way to do this with Big picture/joy2key? someone help :)"
if its gonna be legal then lets get a head start lmao
"any news on the Crossup (stick)?  I want to try one out, official or not :O @Hit_Box   willing to pay to have one custom made as well if theres none available"
Playing fighting games offline has made me realize what I've been missing this quarantine. Can't wait to bootcamp and host sessions once this shits over
Can you restream pound online? Mainly for tomorrow or LATE tonight @VGBC_GimR @VGBootCamp
"Tekken is actually fun offline with friends  MIGHT just give the game another chance, new patch has me inspired"
the absolute tekken god prime leffen returns  salty runback vs zaik
ok time for the realest fighting game the most complicated 3d fighter  naruto ninja storm ultimate 4 boruto dad
"Learning GG XRD! both me and zaik played strive but havent played this one, lets compare! then NARUTO STORM 4"
Live with Day 2 of the Fighting game Marathon!  Now with Timers (1 hour on each game ISH) starting with 15 mins of UNICLR cuz Gordeau is cool then trying out a small game called Footsies then learning GGXRD then P+ then SALTY REMATCH IN TEKKEN
"Today's fighting game marathon stream was a ton of fun, enjoyed playing Granblue, Tekken and learning Gordeau in UNICLR!  Might make this a consistent thing whenever Zaiks over. Tomorrow is Footsies, GGXrd, p+ and Tekken Rematch!"
UNICLR Time!
"Swapping to Tekken 7!  Haven't tried this for a few months, lets try the new char/stage and get salty once more"
"Live! Going to do a fighting game marathon with Zaik! Going to be playing Granblue (First), Tekken, Unist, Guilty Gear XRD (maybe AC?) and more!  ...the biggest problem will be getting our sticks to work on all different games LMAO"
"#FixUltimateOnline trending is both funny and really sad. Going to talk about it tomorrow on stream. Feels like the Ult community is very misinformed when it comes to netcode and such tbh, esp considering recent wifi tournaments."
"Live!  New camera, new audio interface - trying it out and playing Valorant with the boys"
"Spent a lot of money on it, and while I know most people won't notice much of a difference I feel like its only right that I invest money back into the stream since you guys are paying for my food everyday :)"
"So much stream gear arrived today, new camera, acoustic panels, stream deck, new capture card and new audio interface! Going to be nerding out all day trying to set this all up."
LIVE! Going to test the new RTX noise removal software...  on gamecube controllers and stick sounds!  controller sounds a thing of the past? (never) then Valorant grind continues!
We will recover and come back stronger tomorrow.
Valorant solo que makes me almost as sad as playing fighting games online  Rough times in the quarantine
VALORANT STREAM  future TSM valorant leader clocking in  Today im poppin off
Ultimate has 5F minimum delay even on a perfect connection. Known it was close to this since week one but it's still baffling.  Thank god I don't play Ult online anymore *shudders* stay safe everyone
"Streaming!  Got some new stream gear to show off, then Valorant grind for ranked!"
"Great streams today, ty guys for watching! Going to be splitting time between Valorant/Granblue streams for a bit, with some Melee/P+ and just chatting content as well.  Cya guys tomorrow :)"
Valorant stream is back!  Lets get ready for ranked :O oh and drops enabled :)
"I truly believe that the game will be good even if it doesn't get delayed, but man is they're definitely not making it easy to say that with how this was handled. Might make a YouTube rant about all this."
The saddest part is how absolutely terrible of a look this beta was for this game - sadly many people that were hyped up from the announcement at EVO or of rollback netcode are now no longer interested. Fighting game developers seem to always ruin it for themselves.
"Thoughts after 25 or so hours with the closed beta:  Guilty Gear Strive is a fun, good game that needs to be delayed for another year to reach its potential. Lots of interesting ideas that need a TON more polish and some outright awful design decisions such as UI/Lobby."
The definitive Guilty Gear Strive Beta Tierlist  NO QUESTIONS ANSWERED
GG Strive beta is over time for the review/impressions and  TIER LIST lmao
LAST Guilty gear strive Beta! Live now :) Trying new characters this time :D
"Had a much better time playing GG strive today in the second period, but the netplay/lobby experience is still awful to say the least.  Here's a perfect, Ky is really solid and fun :)"
GG Strive is actually a ton of fun WHEN it works getting matches now tho lets try to be positive (try is the key word :))
"GG Strive - PART TWO  Lets hope the lobbys work this time! I'm hyped and hopeful, please don't make me suffer"
I can't believe Arcsys managed to create a worse online experience than Ultimate  (now with full context)
ONLINE IS LIVE!  letsgoooo
"Time for GG Strive Online Matches!  Online Beta test starting very soon, get in here"
"i have officially accepted the deepleffen bot account after this tweet  This is no mere low effort meme account, this is art."
Gonna be helping Jennie find Faust GG strive tech /combos and opening stream equipment that just arrived over on her stream
GG strive is really fucking fun! I can't wait to lab more and play vs everyone online later.   I really wish you could training mode in the beta tho...
link me KY STUFF
what the actual hell were they thinking with this UI
SEND ME GG STRIVE TECH  ANY TECH
LIVE!  GG Strive BETA!!! Servers live now  lets fuckin rock
Strive beta in 2 hours... Going to try to get a nap in now and be live in 2ish hours.  Super hype
Dude GG strive is going to destroy my sleep schedule but I am fucking so hype to stream it   going to be pulling 12 hour streamdays for sure starting tomorrow!
WHEN IS STRIVE BETA GOING LIVE  (SWEDEN TIME)
"Live! Starting with VALORANT, now with DROPSSSS  then reviewing Guilty Gear Strive beta stuff? and playing it???"
What do my fellow Shure sm7b streamers use for filters/obs settings?  overhauling my audio setup so thought id ask  (yes im buying fuckin foams too lmao)
TSM just sent me the smash room concept art its... perfect
can't wait to put a crt and a old gamecube into a $50 million dollar facility :))
Going live!   I'm playing @FINALFANTASYVII REMAKE! @GameFuel is partnering with the game to give fans a chance to win awesome prizes every 7-minutes between 9am-6pm PT beginning today through May 11! Visit   to enter (U.S. Only) #ad
Guilty Gear Strives                        Character design vs UI/Lobby design
"first elgato ive had broke, second ive had so many problems with  insane that one thing can cause so many issues"
"is there literally any fix to @elgatogaming hd60s constantly bluescreening with ""memory management"" as code?  so tired of this, tried everything"
wait can you play strive right now?
Follow up FucK Vinland saga was so good
Today's jam
Addicted to the valorant GRIND  Today started off rough as hell but we endured the rage and salt and popped off at the end! More aim drills tomorrow and tons of ff7 as my reward for grinding :)
"Going live now! Today on Valorant grind - AIM PRACTICE  then starting FF7 (haven't played original, no spoilers!)"
I just don't know how I'd get through the days man
"I feel truly sorry for people who aren't weebs, they'll never get to make breakfast while telling google to play the slightly offpitch lyric version of a japanese band screaming nonsense english mixed with japanese I don't understand from an anime I didn't even particularly enjoy"
valorant grind was hard as fuck today but we take those Ls tomorrow we come back swinging  new day new me
"Live! More valorant today, ff7 if I get tilted :O"
"Valorant grind is grueling but making progress. Getting spikes in performances here and there, just gotta work on increasing consistency and staying sane with leavers/toxic teammates. Ill cya guys tomorrow, ty for watching the grind :)"
Back with more Valorant! Gifting subs everytime I lose lets do this shit
i'm addicted to Valorant so im streaming again IMPROVEMENT DAY 3/14 just got my first ace  FF7 remake later tonight?
"Honestly, the best thing about Valorant to me (outside of the game being good) is that it makes me really fucking hyped for Riots fighting game.  Really promising that they didn't really dumb anything down, went for clarity over particle effects, and prioritized netcode."
Valorant Day 2 GRIND  Maybe FF7 Remake?? lets get good
WITHOUT watching a video and without adding stream delay talking about like 5 seconds
any way to add delay to a twitch stream you're watching?  I wanna watch my games back when streaming but the delay is a bit too low atm
Day 1 of Valorant - this game is really fun to improve at! So many basic things I need to implement and then also learning the abilities and agents... This will take a while but I'll get thru it!
TSM Leffen - VALORANT IMPROVEMENT STREAM 1/14. absolutely no drops come learn how to pickup this new game
"Going to stream valorant in a sec, going to do hardcore improvement training today, got a few cool things to show the stream that I do when trying to learn a new thing.  now you get to see me go from a complete shitter to top ranks.... hopefully :)  on in ~20 to 30 min!"
Valorant is hard as fk and with no CS/FPS exp it'll be rough as hell - but I'm enjoying it a ton! Can't wait to learn more and improve together with my stream :)))
Pro smasher tries New FPS lets see how sick this valorant thing is
Live! Playing the new DLC characters Soriz and Djeeta all day today! Also picking up Zeta cuz shes buffed as all hell. Maybe labbing Vaseraga/Perci/metera too!
Tomorrow tho the stream journey starts!
link me zeta combos! anti air esp!
Zeta seems extremely good now If the top tiers get nerfed in the patch she could become top tier easy.  Will definitely lab her today
HOUR 2 THOUGHTS BTW DONT TAKE TOO SERIOUSLY
"soriz is imo contender for worst character in the game worse ladiva in almost every way  djeeta is fine, worse than gran/kat but maybe comparable after they get nerfed late april"
Soriz and Djeeta AND the huge new balance patch out now! Live :)
any ETA on djeeta/soriz release on PS4?
"streaming some grind granblue for a bit! no mic/cam practice for a while, but ill turn it on before djeeta/soriz are playable :)"
I'll be at the Bo5 setups in the back at UK lobby 1
any good EU PC granblue players who want to play? S/SS/SSS only pls :)
anyone got Router recommendations? and USB-ethernet ones :)
New granblue patched buffing every bad character and not nerfing anyone yet with another big balance patch coming late april is an interesting decision...  Going to go thru it on stream later. Def feel like some buffs are gonna make some chars really scary now
"watching valorant vids, getting ready for the Beta also will be doing aiming drills cuz i have potato aim LMAO"
if you are SS rank in PC europe stop dodging and que up bitches.
"Live! Starting with Granblue, SSS Promotions + Patch notes wishlist! then P+ or Melee all night (chat vote)"
playing warzone with jennie and zaik
late night chill stream just gonna play a bit of granblue and then do some melee derust come play me new music :) (from 2020)
"it really is a shame just how god awful every fighting game but sfv/tekkens ranking systems are, its truly sad"
Is there any EU discord for top granblue players? Feels almost impossible to get consistent high level practice right now because of how few people play ranked (and ppl usually dont stick around if they lose)   if not I guess I'll have to start one
jesus WHY
"new YT vid! quarantine recap, watching and talking about everything that happened in the FGC since this shit started!"
"(manga talk)  kinda weird place to cut it tho, the next season will have a banger start"
jesus that last my hero academia episode had better animation than the entire rest of the season
"doing djeeta analysis now, then analyzing the latest big 3v3 tournament from Japan and maybe patch wishlist at the end :)"
"Live! Back in the Granblue grind, patch soon so doing Djeeta analysis and maybe patch wishlist? quite likely that i'll do a second game later, ill let chat vote"
personally i think valorant looks dope as hell who cares about graphics 1 week in anyway
"Sorry, didn't have any energy to do a proper stream today after food. Trying to rest up a bit since I'm gonna grind super hard in a few days with new granblue patch+dlc and ff7 and (hopefully) valorant beta :)"
more Warzone with the boys cuz im addicted then Granblue with Djeeta analysis and more! maybe late night p+ too
anyone still up for a quick granblue eu pc session come uk lobby 1 first station
its the time to ask again whats the best camera for streaming (camcorder type) it can be expensive as long as its worth  and what else do I need to buy with it to make it work?
TSMs worst Cod warzone player is back playing squads with the boys
"funniest moment in a minute in my stream happened yday lmao, watch both vids  SOUND WARNING the ride continues today"
i dont remember the picture but i assume summit
TSMs worst FPS player plays COD WARZONE with the boys
(yes i know its supposed to be less reliant on abilities than ow its a joke)
i hope i can get into the valorant beta so i can stream myself having 0 aim and still getting a high rank by abusing the genji
I NEED COD WARZONE TEAMMATES NOW HELP HOMIES
"Live now! after a lot of delays due to twitch being shitty.  Lets rant and talk about the ""news"""
"Today in about 3 hours I'll be doing a quarantine/content recap! Gonna just recap everything thats happened in the last month or so, watch somw trailers and rant about Wifi tournaments.  Anything u want me to talk about, reply below (fgc/gaming related only)"
"These online tournaments in Ultimate with big money on the line is just the new Fear Factor.  One horror after another, are you willing to play a bo5 with a sonic for the chance at money? Against a samus?"
I think she might be in her own tier below the top 3 now tbh  but thats because I've labbed a ton  meanwhile kat and gran and lancelot players do the wrong combo every time
my ferry is finally starting to make top 3 players salty  ive succeeded in doing what I wanted by switching from bubz/metera LMAO
Live! Playing Offline games today with @zaik_ssbm  Starting Granblue for a bit then UNICLR!
Late night Granblue stream! working on my ferry also UNICLR PC STREAM??

Made a room. Keyword leffen. A rank and above EU PC!
i keep getting dodged in ranked =(
any good Granblue players wanna play?
New YT vid!  Watching the nintendo direct and talking about the next Ultimate DLC from... Arms.
I can't say shit tho today I ate a mcnugget dipped in both milkshake and barbeque sauce for ten subd
me earlier today: I wonder how all the ultimate players are holding out sitting at home and playing ult online everyday  ult players:
"Playing strong players in Granblue is REALLY fun and also frustrating lmao  I've been improving quickly though because of many rough sessions by many good players, thank you for playing me üôè"
Its time once again  I rage I gift subs granblue edition give me your worst granblue
"Live! Going to be watching the new Nintendo Direct, and talk about the arms DLC character!  come chill :)"
Going to be going over the direct soon on stream and talking predictions on who it'll be from Arms. I bought the game but tbh I only remember the main character and the thottie LMAO
Arms...? Jeez people are going to be disappointed. Probably going to be another DISTANCE DEMON lmao
Live with P+! trying to find a main
on todays stream I try to play granblue but everytime I get salty or rage I gift subs  then we play P+ and do the same thing ...
Aight time for day 2 of learning guilty gear! trying to pick a main... so many cool characters in this game lmao
"Live! Starting with some Granblue, and doing Soriz+Djeeta analysis! Then either Guilty gear or P+ stream, chat will vote"
only gran/katalina players so far... 4/4
im at the bo5 station on UK lobby 1 on PC  (first station u see)
guilty gear is so much fun! gonna play more for sure
back live! tiny bit of granblue and then straight into GG!
I feel like the simpler the game is the saltier you get. Sure I can get salty playing marvel or melee but Granblue and Ultimate have me listening to amvs from 2004 within seconds
cant wait to come back to this tweet after playing vs a  *looks up GG character roster*  any character in guilty gear
granblue feels so fucking broken and unbalanced that im gonna have to play guilty gear to get some perspective  altho it might just makes it more apparant that simple+easy  top tiers are the absolute worst thing to fight in any fighting game
"Live earlier than usual today! Streaming some Granblue first, then learning GG Rev 2!"
"Ultra chill Granblue practice stream, with some GG maybe?"
"If you haven't played a game with good rollback, I seriously think you should try it. I legitimately think 99% of people don't realize that you don't have to fucking suffer every day by playing Ult or some other shitty netcode."
"I'm so excited to play games with rollback I legit can't wait. Going to be able to play everyone in East NA no problem, about to be 10x better as a result.  gonna go haard in strive, so I'll probably do a week of GG rev 2 and maybe some GG AC starting soon"
the swedish SNIPE
my slugger kinda shnasty
it was dope! i'd recommend it for the netcode alone (rollback!) and the chars currently in have really cool concepts. its in EA but still! YT video on it later :)
"playing a new smash-like game that came out yesterday, lets see how good it is"
"millia and zato revealed for Strive! millia Kreygasm  im hype as fuck for everything GG strive now because of rollback announcement lmao, sad the trailer was only 30 seconds long tho =("
New GG STRIVE TRAILER NOW
"and reddit flamed me for saying that the gap was big LMAO, imagine how much more kat/lances there would be if the patch lasted longer"
Really well written article on character representation in Granblue by my boi @MajinTenshinhan   Its honestly insane how 50% of top ranks are playing Lancelot &amp; Kat in a game this young WITH a balance patch announced...
"Live! Starting with some granblue, then going to try a new Smash  like game that just came out, then maybe some P+?"
SMASH FRAUD PLAYS GRANBLUE and maybe P+ vs @zaik_ssbm
jennie doesn't think madoka is worth watching after watching 3 episodes while looking at her phone half the time and I don't know if we can overcome this wall
Lmao this isnt even a tenth or it Shits absolutely wild   My tier list wasn't even considered controversial by most good players standard LMAO
I just read the reddit thread on my granblue tier list and hoooly shit LMAO and here I thought the tekken community hated me
Began making oatmeal recently. Do I call myself a hipster or is that not a thing anymore
"Granblue tier list  Gap is smaller right now but as people get more matchup exp there is literally no reason to play anyone else but Kat/Lance/Gran, and even gran is hard to justify since he struggles vs Kat.  Ferry is good in theory but needs work.  April can't come soon enough."
Starting tier list for granblue! Finally lmao
"Live! Playing + tier list for granblue, then GG strive and Rollback netcode talk (FINALLY WE ARE SAVED)  sub goal for animal crossing stream?"

"Talking about Covid cancellations and a tiny bit of melee practice, then starting my first variety game - ACE ATTORNEY! come chill :)"
"Currently I think I'll try UNICLR more now that its on PC, as well as keep grinding Granblue and Melee :)"
"S3 is way better in most aspects than S2, but it keeps almost all of the core flaws - boring combo routes, lack of REAL synergy, mostly the same type of assists, dull neutral and superdash and dragonrush not being well designed mechanics (IMO)"
"I feel like ultimately DBFZ, even in S3, still doesn't feel like  my type of game unfortunately. The lack of good movement/neutral and the homogenized long block strings make it pretty boring after a while.  Still gonna try it more but I feel like I've grown apart from it =("
"Live! Talking about Smash world tour cancellations, my plans for the month during travel ban and more! then DBFZ :)"
bro remember the GOOD OLD TIMES when we were scared of world war 3 back in january?
Devastating :( going to do a talk about this soon
never been a better time to be a weeb
Man you know who I really feel bad for with all this tournaments being canceled? ultimate players.  imagine how many people stuck in a quarantine playing ultimate online  god save us all they are going to be monsters once they com back
"seriously though, i hope people will tune in to the streams, gotta make something fun going these 30 days to not be really really sad about this :("
Granblue &amp; Chill talking corona and figuring out what games I'll play on stream since tournaments are getting canceled
food then stream probably :)
Really sad :( I sadly expect more events to follow soon. Going to be a streaming spring for me it seems but its for everyone's safety.
"Rewatched code Geass ending, what an amazing ending to a ??? show lmao  What do I need to know to watch the latest movie? Should I rewatch the recap movies?"
oops forgot link
stream later chillin now  watch jennies stream meanwhile :)
"(currently I feel like outside of matchup inexp other chars have little to nothing they are better at than the top tiers, so eventually there will be even less reason to not pick them)"
granblue is fun but oh am i tired of 99% gran/kat/lance can't WAIT for april and hopefully they get nerfed hard... to where other chars can at least compare lmao

"Had some special streams today, but woke up feeling really under the weather today so I unfortunately have to cancel everything today and most likely tomorrow. Sorry everyone :("
any update on full bloom/pound getting canceled? Seems like every event is at risk :o
just been down as shit today and because of various factors but mainly lack of sleep and social media and it doesn't help tbh. you gotta be in a great mood to stream melee and super hard carry since the game doesn't give much for free. fuck today ill cya guys tomorrow
"you guys choose melee, so here we go sheik &amp; fox practice Granblue later because you dont CONTROL ME"
What game do I stream today?
It really took the corona virus to create an off season in esports huh.
Yooo
"the game has a ton of variety now but there's an insane amount of characters that skip neutral, esp with EX moves running rampant.  overall definitely far more enjoyable than S2 though"
after playing dragon ball season 3 ive come to the conclusion that this game is dumb as FUCK now but its fun too
"Live! more DBFZ, checking out Kefla and more practice with my new team :)"
I need to go to bed earlier but ty for all the support during the recent streams :) dbfz is really stupid and fun atm LOL

Restreaming Frostbites! LETS TALK ABOUT ALL THE INSANE UPSETS
"Live! Lots of things planned today, first Ranked grind in Granblue + Learning lancelot and maybe tier list, then Melee grind and also watching Frostbite!?"
Is restreaming frostbite allowed? @VGBootCamp
Live with UNICLR! time to check out the changes and the new character
Live with an early stream! Granblue -&gt; trying out the new game UNICLR!
Checking the full dragon ball season 3 notes! and talking about if I wanna comeback and play android 21 ;)))
Back from the movies with more granblue! also we got full DBFZ patch notes so im gonna go through them :)
"Live with Granblue! Going to be learning Ferry today, and talking about dragon ball season 3 aka DBFZ 2"
Wait... Melee with 2 frame extra delay is 5-6... Where as ultimate offline is 6.  LMAO
"Played @ZainNaghmi  on netplay and we only had 2 frame delay, felt very playable for practice purposes. Def gonna do more of that, its legit better than the perfect ultimate online match by leaps and bounds . Tune in for zain leffen grind session coming to a stream near u."
"sheik practice, summit talk, animal crossing direct? also UNICLR subgoal and Granblue?"
Anyway with that I'm gonna take a break from twitter for a while. Will still post YT/twitch streams and advertise my other content through here but yeah.
I really fucking wish I could just be paid to be a good melee player and live of prize money but sadly the only way to earn a decent living of melee is to be active on social media. So I'll have to deal with you clowns somehow. fucking hell.
This website makes me seriously consider quitting melee more than anything else. Its just filled with fucking insects who want nothing but to shit on people who give their all for our game. I've long since given up on any constructive or productive discussion for melee on Twitter
"So many fucking coasters and lazy people constantly shitting on the people who work the hardest in and for the game, and almost no support and interesting content at all.  No ruleset talk, no talk about Slippi/unclepunch, no guides on how/why to get into netplay/melee. Its sad."
"Melee twitter/reddit has probably never been in a more toxic state than in 2020 tbh. Any remotely rational discussion or thought gets taken completely out of context for a sick ""burn/hot take"".  Almost nothing productive ever happens on here either like it does for other games."
Goodnight fuckers
"Took it easy today, back streaming melee/granblue/summit recap tmrw"
Overall tho the game is incredibly balanced for a first patch. Very slight nerf to the top if they are still better later on and slight buffs to the bottom and it'll be perfecg
"I feel like currently Metera is definitely in the ""not worth the effort"" category, not because she is bad, its just that Gran/Charlotta/Kat are soooo much easier and while also being significantly better  IMO.  Ferry might be the only high effort char worth it tbh"
Anyone got tech for Sheik vs Marth? Send me the dirt
"Rethinking my streams and my content in general. Going to be making shorter streams with more high effort content the norm, and then also have some practice/bootcamp streams inbetween will less interaction. And I'm going to do merch. And I wanna do it well."
"Outside of that, I'm really stoked Melee and Summit is doing so well. We're in for one of the best years of melee ever I'm sure, and I'm happy and proud to be a part of it."
"Heading back to Sweden now.  Going to have to work way harder and smarter than anyone else if I'm going to do better without moving to a better region.  So that's what I'm fucking going to do, simple as that. Not giving up."
What movie is more iconic?
#NewProfilePic
What a sad day
Commentste plup vs hbox yes or no?
Feeling a bit better now so if you're at summit please don't feel the need to talk about my performance or ask how I'm feeling. Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I'll overcome the odds. Maybe not today but someday. For fucking sure.
Anyway I guess I'm off to try to heal off twitter. God knows nothing positive can come from reading what people who take pleasure in seeing people miserable have to say. My stupid brain just can't seem to stop but I'll have to get better if I wanna survive this shit.
"Either quitting competing, taking a break or moving to the shithole for half a year I guess. Such a fucking shame."
Not really sure what my path from here is. It's clear that my practice conditions are just such utter fucking garbage and its a straight up miracle me and armada have ever been able to compete. Now that the people from good regions are only kinda lazy its feels insurmountable.
It really feels so fucking awful to be me sometimes. I don't even know how to describe this fucking suffering and shame
Haven't even played halfway decent once this year and its so fucking frustrating as all hell. Sets like these two today and the two at genesis just makes me wanna stop competing. I don't fucking know how I'm supposed to fix it living in a fucking garbage region either.
Played like complete absolute omega fucking garbage this entire day. Cody made some good adaptations but I can't feel good about a loss due to shit tech skill and tilting.
My bad for using twitter during tournament. Forgot how many fucking cockroaches there are watching melee.
But yeah I need to stop letting it get to me mentally. Even if the matchup is hard its a bad mindset to have and I try my best not to tilt but its so fucking hard.
So fucking frustrating to lose to marth and falco with fox. I think they both clearly win in a tournament setting (marth esp obv) and its just so fucking mentally taxing to feel like you have to play perfect when they can yolo fsmash and get entire stocks of it but its my b.
The uncrustables eaten at one Summit could feed a small village
Its spreading We're in the endgame now
"Definitely got pretty screwed over/unlucky by the format but meh, I'm used to it at this point.  Pools are good for scores for the end of the year and everything else is dependent on how much the other people pool plays out. Happy I beat wizzy none axe &amp; spark regardless!"
Playing mango tomorrow cuz he got fucked by plup LOL If he had taken a game id play plup. It'll be a fun time at least
Swiss has so much throwing potential Im gonna get canceled
"Its great for viewership tho so I get it, can't say summit hasn't earned exploiting us a little bit. Important to know tho that none of todays set really matter much for the top seeds"
"Got one more set today, gonna take it easy and keep conserving energy for tomorrow. Wayyy too many sets this summit, my least liked format IMO"
"Its pretty cool honestly, I've adamantly stated that it was a clear counter ever since 2013 and 7 years later people are finally getting good enough to where its showing!  On to the next one"
"Outplayed zain a bunch in neutral, got nothing from anything due to good DI and SDI, and messed up a bit  edgeguarding and waveshining. Happens, good I tried fox but it's definitely just a terrible matchup. Gotta play sheik or 12/10 fox to have a a chance but I'll make it work"
"Playing zain next, gonna do my best to outplay him."
"Streaming! Talking about my 3-0 at summit so far, dog washing, mafia etc"
"Summit is so insane, been improving so much. Wish I could practice like this more often! Us europeans need it"
"Played like a 9/10 vs axe except I got backthrown fifty times LMAO  Super happy, went 3-0 today beating Wizzy/Axe and Spark!  Good stuff to @spotdodge_shine as well, analysis really helped!"
"Didn't play too much today because of side content, but tomorrow I'm grinding. Sleeping early because I've felt a lil sick recently"
Dogwasher/datingsim god live from summit
I actually love iced matcha with almond milk
Ganondorf marth is better than fox marth
Good thing is my sheiks getting better and winning more and more vs zain. Just gotta actually learn to play sheik because I fsmash twice a stock lmao
I swear marth fox will eventually be 10-0 LOL
"Happy I'm done with joke events, only got the next super serious event left (dating sim) then I can chill. Might stream a lil"
We did it (kinda)
Either way I'll make more money than I did at genesis LOL
Never washed a dog before Lets see if the gamer genes prevail or if me being a cat person rears its ugly head
"Finally done with swag bracket, dog washing soon"
I got nothing for the swag bracket lmfao
Melee content? on youtube? New summit .5 trashtalk and combo highlights up now ;)
"and miss me with that ""but X has bo3"" Two wrongs don't make a right. If you have time to run it, lets make sure that the better player wins more often."
"I feel like people who compare SFV to Granblue in damage output don't realize that in Granblue you don't need Vtrigger and bar from last round to 2 or 3 touch someone, and it rely on stun either, it can just be two anti airs or frame traps. And throws do 15% and give safejump"
"Inb4 ""Omg typical smasher thinks people will ever get hit by jumpins or get hit in the corner, smh get real"""
"""You know I really just play Gran because I like his personality and his moves feel good to use, idk why""  Also Bo5 pls"
Ooo yeah
"How does gameshare work for ps4? They have a ps4 here, can I somehow get my granblue copy on it?"
I have a plus one spot available for summit if theres anyone good nearby :)
Also is there any puffs at summit or closeby LOL
Anyone got granblue at summit üëÄ

Aight ty for the help I think I got it figured our
Landed in LA!  Thinking about Granblue but I'm hyped to focus on Melee this week and to get soo much better :)
"Happy Parasite won things, not because the oscars really mean shit but because the headlines it makes will make people see more good movies."
LAST GRANBLUE STRAEM EVER until I get back from summit lets get it REAL QUICK leaving soon
"Midset coaching and the pools are meh but yeah, compared to Capcom cup/Evo its laughable how much better this event was to watch from home"
This event has had ridiculous production value. Really set the bar IMO
"This grand finals was the perfect display of DBFZ season 2. Amazing stuff, and pure greatness by @GO13151   Can't wait for how season 3 pans out!"
WHAT IS THIS ANIME
Sage played his heart out tho üò≠

Sad to see my goons lose :( its all up to you now sage!

New dragon ball fighterz changes seem really interesting! 3 assists each :O
WOOO
Cute cats ( ‚óú‚Äø‚óù )‚ô°
Midset coaching SLEEP
Granblue is really fun except when I play vs Charlotta online There really always gotta be that one fucker huh
"Yet another reason why #GBVS should be Bo5 :) Round start, no meter required, throw/2A bait into high low #GBVS_MT"
"Playing some offline granblue, really enjoying this game! Feels like a parry less 3rd strike honestly"
Granblue time!

Stayed up for a billion hours on little sleep then woke up after 4 Why
I still can't sleep WHY
"Byleth up B combos are a complete meme btw, DI behind gets out for free with no counterplay and leaves byleth in a terrible spot. Sad that his most unique move is basically useless offensively."
20 hour stream wowie  New YT video up on it
"YL buffs are big, all of them matter but fthrow is still not a real kill throw.  Character is still hilariously badly made tho, bombs and up B being essentially random and kills, usmash dropping, bair dropping ,fair dropping etc  Pretty fun to kill consistently tho"
My opinion of byleth is even worse after some offline play. No way this character is high tier.
BYLETH IS HERE + BIG BUFFS/NERFS 7.0 PATCH IS OUT  offline session all day with the new shit
its still early but byleth kinda shit tbh
BYLETH WALKTHROUGH NOW
JUST WOKE UP BYLEFF IS HERE WHAT TOP TIERS ARE DEAD COME HERE

honestly unbelievable that melee keeps thriving no matter what happens. happy to be apart of it.
melee is the fucking best
super proud of you @ZainNaghmi  deserved it for sure after all those heartbreaks
fuck yea
come on zain.
Time to pick my poison
Was gonna get a bottle of vodka and then I remembered my stomach fucking sucks now NOOO not a sober 5th place NOOOOO
"Anyway I'm off the internet for a bit because it's time for the jims to heckle me for a few weeks for getting 5th.  Sorry to the real ones for the shitty play, I'll bounce back."
"...but that 0,1% tho"
"That's just competing for you.  Pure fucking hell 99,9% of the time."
"Although 5th place isn't too bad, my play today was legit abysmal. Worst tech skill and punish game I've had since 2017 easily. Tried adding too many new things before the tournament coupled with streaming too much so my basics were dogshit under pressure. Extremely sad but yeah"
"Hax played good and has been putting in mad work recently, same thing to Mango. They deserved it more today.  GGs."
"Played like complete shit today, pretty embarrassing but it happens. That's just what me not playing enough melee and fox being fox can do for ya.  5th ain't too bad to start my comeback off with I guess. We'll take it all things considered!"
Definitely gonna be one of those sets that I'll have nightmares about LMAO god I hate falco sometimes
Proud for even bringing that one close. Played like complete shit and that's you can't do that vs falco LOL but kept it together mentally at least. Let's do it better in losers.
Top 8 starting. Lets fucking play some melee
RIP :(
Slept 9 hours straight because I was at the other hotel LOOLLL for once the european will be the well rested one
Goodnight everyone

TOP 8 winners celebration stream watching the rest of the genesis matches and EVO japan top 8!
Dude there's a million great sets going on at the same time
"Also if you give me shit for popping off for an SD LOLlLLL. I just instinctively reacted to winning, I had no idea how I won in that moment.  I didn't keep screaming or rolled on stage after I realized what happened :v"
"Dude what a fucking set WOOO Fiction had a lot of good momentum going and I didn't play good enough to keep up some games, but through sheer clutch and will I brought it back!  Sad to have it end on a SD but thats also how it started lmao"
Beat Hax 3-0 playing solid! Next up is fiction... One last fox ditto to qualify for top 8. Let's get it!
"Beat MikeHaze 3-0, next up is winner vs Hax and N0ne. Excited to play more melee!"
I love y'all my fans but you gotta learn to CHILL during majors :(
Also top player complaint type: the amount of people coming up to the stream warmup stations WHILE me/others are playing to warmup for stream setups is crazy. Really wish they roped it off like last year.
"Scary start! Picked it up well after that. Made it to Bo5! Really wish they started running it earlier, so many great sets cut short."
hElP For melee
Any falcons who can help me warmup? By the stream warmup stations
Quick Day 1 Hotel stream while I wait for food! get in here
"Well on the bright side at least my game   doesn't have Leroy, I legit feel so bad for all Tekken players. Kinda unbelievable how badly designed that character is considering how long tekken 7 has been out."
One way or another I am fucking every marth main up this year.... But it probably won't be with fox LMAO
"Playing Marth Fox actually feels like playing Ultimate for me.  I go in with all these things I wanna try to implement and work on, with a positive and motivated mind.  I leave disgusted, with less hope in humanity"
Its time boys
Pleaseee up the temperature a bit for tomorrow if possible @Genesis_Smash @sheridactyls @boba_ck  Gonna bring tons of handwarmers but it's never enough
Am I the only one who thinks the genesis venue is too cold? Getting bkg house feelings out here
honestly expected to be in a lot of pain since american food is so bad for you lmao
"for anyone wondering about my health, stomach has been better than expected recently! really happy that's not gonna be a big problem this weekend (knock on wood)"
"So exhausted today, and its not jetlag this time lmao just my stupid ass streaming 12 hours a day this week. Definitely not making that mistake again this year. Unsub if I stream too much before a major lmaoo"
"And yeah, its not like US players have a good record of traveling to EU events either, and when they do it's always complaints about jetlag etc"
"But yeah if you're one of the morons who think jetlag and traveling 20 hours to every event is the same as no jetlag and a 1hour flight and that its just ""not feeling 110%"" you are so fucking dumb. Jetlag and traveling sometimes just fucks you even if you take precautions."
"this is not trying to shit on ultimate, this is just speaking honestly.  Point is that you can't really expect international players to attend more than 5 majors a year with the current prizepools. That said I plan on attending a lot more than last year in 2020 :)"
"just to be clear, many times when I dropped out of Melee in 2019 was because I was struggling with health and jetlag due to work and especially all the traveling. I ended up playing Ultimate at some of those events because its a much easier game that requires way less of me."
Regardless of rank I'm very proud of my performances last year in both games. Did way better than I expected in 2 games while focusing on my stream and new appartment. Can't wait to see what I can do this year!
"I considered myself tied for 2nd with mango long before rankings came out, and I still do. He should've clearly been number 1 seed at genesis tho, thats a worse fuckup imo. PGR don't mean shit"
"honestly been snubbed by PGR like 6 times in 2 different games and I feel like this is the one time I might not have deserved it LMAO.  I do think that people need to value attendance higher for the health of our scene. I personally struggle since its EU, but wizzy/m2k??"
got 2nd  this time the pgr panelist rewarded consistency next year itll be peaks/attendance  good fucking riddance tbh
talking about all the CRAZY STORIES I HAVE AND THE SMASHERS I MET ON THE WAY TO GENESIS WOW
EVO JAPAN RESTREAM - GENESIS HOTEL STREAM :)  streaming to keep myself awake come chill
Anyone at genesis who can let me borrow a ucf/unclepunch memory card? Got crt figured out :)
If there's anyone who can lend me a setup for the weekend (crt with unclepunch) it would be awesome. Ofc willing to pay!
Not much has changed since last year with the penguin debacle
genesis seeding is straight ass lmao
Watching PGR and talking about new system - LAST STREAM BEFORE GENESIS !
I know I can still do this shit though. I'll make it work.
Always happens when you're trying to implement new stuff but yeah. Gonna make sure I get it down eventually even if Genesis might be hit or miss. Long term improvement is needed after two years of half assing melee.
"Feeling kinda ??? about my play going into genesis tbh. Playing a mix of amazing and terrible, often at the same time. Probably is because I've been trying so much new shit. Gotta scale it back a bit but I definitely intend to push my limits this year so it'll take some time."
Everytime I play fox I'm both reminded of why he's one of the best designed characters ever and also why so many top foxes quit LMAO. Fox life is fucking rough sometimes :( But sometimes....:))
"I feel like fox kinda sucks in this meta because I've been busy with dbfz/ult/streaming and haven't been pushing the character like I used to, combined with everyone practicing so much vs fox. Gonna have to get back in the lab &gt;:("
big uber ride to mangos dont ask me shit
"leaving for mangos once traffic settles, ultra chill until then! checking ultimate brackets, making fantasy bracket??"
LAST DAY BEFORE GENESIS! Reviewing brackets etc! Subgoal to go to @C9Mang0 s place later :) also talking nintendo sponsoring Genesis...
playing the mang
playing vs @iBDWSSBM
Time to talk about EVO japan and nintendos support (or lack therof) and also watch PGR!
"EVO Japan/Prizepool talk, PGR talk, Genesis talk, etc! Starting off with some melee warmup then gonna do my ted talks"
Is genesis seeding final or are they still changing shit  I still think its fucked up tbh
playing vs Mango
with gold smash mark tho IM TRYNA COP
"Talking Glitch, people hating on characters in ULT, Genesis practice, etc starting now!"
"I might hate a lot of things in ultimate but that's also why I'm focusing on other games now. Its sad to me how many people think that hating 90% of the cast is just standard and how a fighting game should be.  I got paid a ton to suffer through that, what's your excuse LMAO"
honestly not hating on other ultimate characters is a cool idea and all but I don't think it'll ever happen. Its a combination of the community being centered around whining &amp; patch culture instead of grinding and there being a lot of very toxic characters.  It's still sad tho.
12 hour stream today what the fuck
why the fuck do people let pika/pichus go to fd/kalos lmao
Glitch top 8 starting now! Still restreaming and big chillin
why is the box first seed at genesis lmao
"Live from LA! Talking my trip here + bootcamp plans, watching Glitch, Byleth analysis (why this character will prob suck) and Melee practice!"
can you restream glitch? @VGBC_GimR @VGBootCamp
Slept around 21 out of the last 24 hours get on my fucking level bitches
Landed in the US! Tired -_-
#NewProfilePic
I'm only 2 episodes in but Eizouken is already amazing. Yuasa does it again
Feel like I'm gonna play some fucking sick Melee this year
"Going to Socal tomorrow, last home stream for a while! staring out with some pure melee grind, byleth talk and pgr shit later"
Live! Melee practice with the boys for Genesis Talking how SAD I AM ABOUT THE NEW DLC :''(((
Direct recap up on YT! Title: I'd rather have sora LOL
"The biggest takeaway from whether you like Byleth or not is that there will be SIX more DLC characters, releasing all the way until end of 2021.  That means we will have at LEAST 2 more years of completely unplayable online :("
MARTH 10 COMING TO SMASH
DIRECT STARTING  COME WATCH THE LAST CHARACTER GET REVEALED
Live! Nintendo direct in 1 hour exactly! Time for the crackhead theories
Smash direct stream starting soon! i just woke up lmao
"New YT Vid! Watching and breaking down every single Break the Target record, and comparing them to the TAS version as well! Really enjoyed this one, favorite vid in a long time. RT if you enjoy it as well :)"
watching New melee/Ult pgr Now No spoilers then melee
"Alright, time to watch the Granblue Character preview! time to pick a main :O"
"Live! Talking DLC direct tomorrow, &amp; Genesis Melee practice, and Granblue Preview + maybe trying out SFV Netcode patch:O?"
also hospital story maybe
"New DLC talk + Predictions, PGR?, Valhalla celebration, unboxing stuff, talking Genesis plans &amp; much more! Live now!"
"Still no clear diagnosis on stomach problems, but its very unlikely its something serious. I will still be taking it easy and making extra sure I take care of myself for a while."
"Had a bit of a health scare today - was sent to the Emergency ward after my doctor's appointment because they wanted to do more tests to look for something serious, but all tests came back good and I'm on my home now :)"
Really happy Granblue is starting out with a proper training mode! Now all we need is a decent netcode...
January 16th huh... Same date as the direct üëÄüëÄ Please let me have Dante in smash
Big boy reach tbh
"Random ass theory: sakurai holding up three fingers and theres three question marks. New DLC is from Three houses, a regular character + two echos, two different characters where one has an echo, or Pokemon trainer 2 with three different pokemon :)"
ITS TIME
Rewatched Rush and started a watching Formula one Netflix docu series and boy I am inspired
PGR LOL literally never disappoints
"But eventually, if those guys stick to it, it'll start adding up fast. It's already begun tbh"
I think we'll see more and more up n coming players that steal away the lazy players who are satisifed with their C tier sponsor and their occasional C tier top 8 placement. Almost all the players that I met thru Ult that worked hard were players who aren't yet top 50.
Also since this is ranking season aka pat my self on the back season let me hit you with some facts  Legit almost no one outside of the top 10 in Ultimate would make it in basically any other competitive game with how lazy u guys are. It's insane how much ppl waste their talent.
"And much more obviously, but those are my personal highlights I think.  I wish I could've continued now that I feel like I'm very close to the top level, but honestly it's very unlikely I continue unless I fall in love with the new DLC, or if the online gets better (lol)"
"For a game with such insane rewards for playing S4, its all I really aimed for, and I did that and then some. Beat: Maister with no G&amp;W exp 2-0. Salem (S4 Evo winner, lived with Leo) Tweek (Evo finalist, 2nd best player in the world) Mr R (S4 evo finalist) + i'm the best PT ;)"
"For myself, I'm quite satisfied with how I performed with my time in Ultimate if I end up never entering another event again. Focused mostly on streaming and content, and despite taking a break and living in a rough region, I managed to be by far the best non-smash 4 player :)"
"The real crime here is against the people who constantly and consistently place well in Europe but who can't travel to the us much, such as Quik , Space, Meru etc, have it 10x as hard as a random ass US player to make it on, and get sponsored and play full time."
"Actually let me delete the tweet, pgr deserves no fucking clicks from me LOL I was area 51. Literally never cared about PGR, but its hilarious to see that despite the complaints last time, its somehow still just as insanely biased, if not more so, against smaller regions."
Top 10 worst experiences in my life.
The bar went open mic and I seriously appreciate Joker more as a movie now. Never seen a man lose it that bad. He. Just. Kept. Screaming.
This game is the best
"Won Valhalla 3!  Started feeling better after first set of top 8, and played smart. I wanted to be a bit more on point but I played good when it mattered then held leads well enough! Shoutouts to everyone for coming and for everyone who helped hosted the event! Ran well :)"
Any foxers at valhalla tryna help me warmup
"Up in top 8 soon, vs Frenzy. Stomach issues are back but ima try to tough it out for now, hopefully it doesn't get worse again!"
Streaming a lil while I wait for my top 8 winners match. Recapping matches and talking upsets that happened in melee+ Ultimate so far here at valhalla!
Really takes the joy out of competing even when I do win :(
Really fucking tired of always having to deal with something mid tournament but it seems like it's always the case lately. I still need to work more on my health I guess :(
"Decided to try and play my first couple of matches at Valhalla since I felt barely ok now. Only for a few sets of genesis practice really, no expectations on my play. Won't hesistate to drop out if my stomach starts hurting more again or if fever starts acting up tho :("
Btw
Back streaming again! Any Ult top players at Valhalla wanna play me :)?
"For people AT VALHALLA LMK if u wanna play me in ult, I'm at the stream setups"
"Streaming from Valhalla! Gonna try to get some Ultimate sets in vs top players ,and talking general schtuff like upcoming Nintendo direct?"
"Was in no shape to get up for my Ultimate pool so ended up getting DQd. Will try to play my melee pool today in case I feel significantly better for tomorrow, but if it stays the same I can't justify playing :("
Fever shakes + stomach pains is a shitty fucking combo :( I really hope this passes soon :((
"Fever feels better today so it's still possible that I can play come Sunday, but no promises. Gotta prioritize my health for once :("
Had stomach problems ever since Dreamhack. I think I hated playing Ultimate literally gave me an ulcer... LOL. Heading to the doctor on Tuesday but this weekend is rough af - stomach pains + fever :(
are you serious
my fever is real bad :(
(at valhalla))
"Fuck I was supposed to stream from valhalla but I forgot my capture card lmao, does anyone have an extra one I can borrow?"
"Ideally you'd have both styles in one character, swapping stance through down B, but that wouldn't really be canon"
"Urshifu = perfect DLC for Ultimate, with an Echo fighter for the other fighting style. I bet it'll be the first character after the Challenger Pass."
Got a pretty rough fever but I'm still going to try to attend valhalla. Plan is to rest up and hopefully feel ok for sunday. Really sad and unfortunate timing but that's how it be.
ultimate is lame STATEMENT
I can't wait
Knives out was very entertaining :)
I think I managed to get sick day before valhalla... God damnit lmao Oh well I'll try to sleep it away
Pokemon DLC in Direct? Ult at Valhalla??? + Lets Make Moves Rewatch! Then meleeeeee practice :)
Pokemon trainer 2 for Ultimate please
DLC announcment should be really soon though and I'm still planning on analyzing Lets make big moves and a new 6.1 tier list at some point - I'm just focusing on melee for a bit since I've been rusty in that game for too long.
"(not entering at genesis either, I'm only registering for one game per supermajor since people are penalizing people for DQing lmao)"
"did some melee offstream had a great time  probably not entering ultimate at valhalla btw, haven't practiced since DH and got no plans to until next DLC character."
horribly rusty at melee but having soooo much fun holy shit i love this game
"(that said i think my react videos wasn't actually low effort and the upcoming one on all Break the targets records is even more indepth, but I also realize that people just click for the thumbnail/title :c)"
its both sad and amazing that reaction content on youtube does way better than high effort content lmao
What is wrong with Lets make big moves lmao did they shadownerf all non campy characters
"New Youtube video! This one reviews @bananaboyssb s video on how to fight every character in Ultimatr, as well as my own personal tips on how to fight them! Great video overall, ultimate community needs more of these to bridge the gap between S4 players!"
"Live! Starting with Genesis Melee practice and watching BTT videos, then restreaming and chilling with Lets make Big Moves!"
and the occasional doggo
"Reached 40k, thanks everyone :)  will post more cat pictures as thanks"
Melee practice + lets make big moves restream all day today!
"Live now! The Dbfz champ back from the tournament, talking about it and watching videos"
Can you restream Lets Make Moves? @EvenMatchup @VGBootCamp
"Follow my instagram for more, almost at 40k followers!"
Had a great time playing fighting games today!  Still (barely) got it in DBFZ :)
Fgc tourney results 2-2 in Tekken 1-2 in UNIST 4-2 in SFV Won DBFZ
time to go 0-2 in sfv and unist
"Got 9th in tekken, lost to a gigas (never seen before) and a master Raven (played one, first day of ranked lmao) 2-1. Brought it to last hit both matches i lost :(  oh well, my tekken ""career"" was short and beautiful"
entering dbfz/unist/tekken/sfv  considered samsho and usfiv but I don't wanna hold up brackets lmao  haters will still call my arguments irrelevant because i only play smash tho
heading to my fgc local and entering 4 or more games on 4 hours or less of sleep   this can only end in absolute disaster
you are fucking insanely tone deaf if you took this seriously lmao
the fact that people took this seriously is fucking insane jesus
I can't sleeeep aaaaa
melee is dead tho
MultiMod Melee - NO ILLEGAL MEMES PLS playing with the new mods and new stages!
any way to load the @UnclePunch_ MultiMod launcher through dolphin?
2019 REVIEW Starting now! + Lets make moves predictions
Road to Diamond LUL  -SFV Day 3- Year in Review + Lets Make Moves review Later!
Legit amazing stuff.
Remember at the beginning of the decade when we thought this was the worst music could be  years later and i unironically think its a banger
Happy new year
No stream today! Going to be chillin and drinking to celebrate new year's.  Cya all in 2020!
"Year in Review - Last stream of the decade! Going through my year, favorite things, most hated things, best tournaments, best sets, worst beefs, &amp; more! Then SFV/Melee :)"
last bnha ep - mirio üò≠ was a great ep but I wish they wouldn't cheap out so much on animation :(
RT/subscribe/etc if you want another one of these for UNIST/SFV and more!  ...Hopefully people realize that I'm just speaking about my personal experience  and that I really think Tekken is great but I have a feeling people won't take it well :(
"Before I head to bed - here's my Tekken  ""Review""/first impressions vid!  I know people get extremely mad when I critique peoples favorite games but here it is :v"
"Ty for tuning, its awesome to see so many tune in regardless of what fighting game I'm playing. Will keep playing SFV for a bit, then maybe have subs vote on the next game I try!"
"SF V was fun! Kolin is cool, netcode sucks dick but at least its better than ultimate :)"
"Street Fighter V CE Stream :) Day 2 of SFV, learning Kolin and maybe one more character?"
LATE NIGHT UNIST
playing my favorite game melee with the Boys
quick offline Tekken STREAM last tekken stream evar then melee later tonight!
I just registered for Valhalla III   #Valhalla3 via @smashgg
"No stream today, out drinking :)"
my christmas gift to myself is letting myself play melee
god jul everybody
"I will say, if you think you'll be into Tekken and don't mind learning through YT and a game with a big movelist and a few wonky legacy mechanics, its on sale right now for steam! So now is a good time if you do wanna try it."
"Had a good time streaming Tekken today, and did my review. Full video will be up on youtube but TLDR: tekken 7 is a great game but its not for everyone, and without an active offline scene I'd rather spend my time in a game that I like more. Ty for watching!"
"Live with Tekken 7! Going to do to my Review/first impressions, learn a new character, and watch some more vids on how to learn the game"
"Might make a video on this in the future, feels like it might fall on deaf ears to the people who need it the most though."
"I feel like there's so many low/mid level players in FGs that don't think cheese/gimmicks exist because ""if it works its good"" lmao.  Its both baffling and sadly the most common pitfall keeping people from ever becoming good at a fighting game."
"It's going to be completely honest, but also not overly harsh nor kind. Basically if I recommend others to pickup the game and the mechanics/characters I like the most and hate the most lmao."
"wasn't really in the mood to stream today, sorry guys. tomorrow I will do my recap of my first week of tekken, ""review/first impression"" kinda deal. I'll do it on stream but it'll also be on Youtube."
Online fighting games are probably a torture device made by satan im sure
"Had a great day today, woke up and saw a great movie, and then went home and ate some dope sushi. Then I played against fifteen cheesers in tekken who ran the first match they lost and about thirty leeroys and now I want to die. So all in all just the usual"
"Saw Parasite, amazing movie! Had me on the edge of my seat and it constantly surprised me. Big recommend :)"
"Thanks for watching, SFV was pretty fun to try out after all these years! Ed seems interesting :)"
"filthy smasher tries actual fighting game xd trying out new season of Street fighter V, haven't played since season 1! gonna try to find a main and get some practice for granblue :o"
"Live! Back with some ultimate christmas chill, then Tekken or SFV :o"
Playing now :O eating cake soon :)
"I don't think I've ever said ""you're just too bad"" at someone expressing a problem they have with melee, a game just as hard (imo harder) as tekken.  Sometimes you don't see the solution yet, so tell em, and other times its a subjective (a legit) complaint. Git gud is never right"
"Tekkens engine is a VERY unique one, and because of how much legacy there is left and that its 3D means that it won't be for everyone, even if they go through the first initial rough learning curve.  Saying Git Gud to any critiscm just makes you look like a Dark Souls fanboy."
"""learn 80+ moves per character and 40 matchups then you are allowed to complain that the game has no tutorial"" Smh, I might have been too harsh sometimes but you can have legit complaints about any FG even if you haven't won EVO in it."
"Not going to be able to make it, but might host a bootcamp right after for Granblue if any goons are interested in flying from france :))))"
"I feel like if you have someone teaching you this game and understand fundamentals well it really isn't as hard to get good at as people make it out to be, but you absolutely can't ""just play"" and expect to get better."
"In general I enjoy tekken but I also hate big character rosters with tons of cheese, its a bit too close to Ultimate in that respect. At least this game has proper counterplay once you DO lab it, but its very hard to get the chance to apply things cuz of the amount of chars+moves"
"Learning tekken is an absolute mess though. Had to use so many different bots/spreadsheets &amp; basically everything is outdated or incomplete. Mid level tekken seems to be basically straight üßÄüßÄüßÄüßÄ and hope they don't know the MU, lame af tbh. At least top level looks different."
Also I keep losing like 2 ranks because I rematch all the smurfs until I start beating them and they run LMAO
"Made Genbu (red rank) in Tekken on my 7th day of playing Tekken :o I definitely still suck in every MU knowledge wise lmao Think I got there in 175 wins, pic is a bit after. this game has soooo many cheesers haha"
"New YT video!  First tekken video on youtube, showing how I pickup new games! Subscribe/RT if you want more content like this :)"
"Its not TERRIBLE but its also far from good. So many facepalm moments and so few good moments. Sequel trilogy as a whole is just a complete mess tbh. The only good parts are the casting and the visuals of some parts, rest is üòî"
man thinking back on the star wars movie now that im sober oh nooo
Im coming for you @toph_bbq
The boys goes to the Mall
My one tip to happiness in life and beyond: watch the new star wars movie three beers in at LEAST
Pour one out for my boy
Star wars.... LMFAO what a soulless movie
What do I get myself for Christmas?
"managed to push this one out from jail, hope you law abiding citizens enjoy it too :O"
New YT video!  Going through the new footstool tech and exploring and discussing how it'll be used and what moves it works against.  RT if you want more smash vids :)
"I don't think I'll be streaming today, going to buy some Christmas stuff, drink a few cold ones with the boys and then go see the new probably shitty star wars movie"
impeachment is great even if it might not eventually end up leading to trump getting kicked out of office. god bless.
I fucking can't believe twitter lately.  Good night.
are you fucking blind
"Footstool invincibility will definitely be fixed, just like the online, and the buffer glitches got fixed. Remember when multi hit moves randomly didn't connect? Yeah I'm so happy that's fixed. In fact I have full faith in Nintendo"
lmao this is not okay xd
"talking about footstool tech, ,labbing it, maybe kongo saga analysis"
people talking out of their ass without testing it once -_-
ultimate is something special man
testing more moves atm
"Tap jump makes the footstool tech 100% guaranteed, just hold up and it buffers every single time this game is fucking DEAD"
LMAO we just actually found the actual broken part about about gimrs tech TAP JUMP pikachu MALDING
OMG ULTIMATE 2.0 IS OUT GIMR VIDEO LIVE ON STREAM NOW
"Live! Streaming some Offline Ultimate practice, playing PT/Joker/GAW also waiting for Gimrs gamebreaking Ult video :OO"
Had a good time streaming tekken today :)
"Going live now! Talking some about Tekken, then some matches with Zaik, maybe some UNIST as well"
"I really don't want there to be more bad blood between the fgc and smash, there's been more than enough already. Going to go through it more on stream today but I definitely said some shit I regret when I was mad so I wanted to get that out right away. Sorry!"
"I want to apologise for my behavior yesterday, got into a really shitty mood after a few days of frustrating streams and I was too hard on the general Tekken community and the game itself when my problem really lies with a vocal minority. My B :("
Anyway going out for a bit. Might stream later tonight for a discussion on the subject or just relax with some elite smash (lmao)
"Like even if I'm completely off the fucking mark right and I was just unlucky, and the tekken online community is wholesome, why the fuck do you think the right response is to start hating on someone for describing his experience?"
"Not saying the offline community is anything less then awesome, im sure it is, but I'm a looking to stream the game so if the online community is this toxic then it makes me significantly less likely to want to play it. Anyway hopefully it'll stop now."
"Deleted it cuz I'm done blocking people for today :) Positive vibes only, ty to the people who helped me with Tekken!"
"trying some more tekken, day 5 learning zafina? then prob some Ult analysis mby come be nice :))"
"I sincerely hope that it's just extremely bad luck over an entire week, but I can't say I think that's likely."
"Don't think I've ever had such a terrible first impression, out of all the fighting games I've played, but im sure people will dismiss it as not a real problem because there's other communities that are also toxic."
"when FGC players try ultimate, this really doesn't happen much at all. It's sadly a real problem that randoms in the ""FGC"" are spiteful towards newcomers, especically smashers. It's really sad honestly, burns bridges for both communities. Games should be something to bond over."
"Never been much for SFV but I might mess around with a bit on stream if people want to watch, just to get some prep for Granblue."
seth looks cool but when is SF6
"Happy for idom, punk clearly got nervous but it was a great set nonetheless!"
"I'll give it another chancebut but I'm not sure if I'll stream that. Tekken randoms are hilariously toxic for some reason, legit makes Ultimate chat look okay sometimes LMAO."
"Got a lot better today so thats nice but man its a hard game to recommend unless you already know you love 3d games with a ton of tekken specific legacy mechanics. Online is trash, and tutorial and general learning experience is awful.  Games still fun when it works tho."
"Playing Tekken on stream: 3 helpful people in chat, 10 people saying filthy smashers, 300 people who are just generally mean to new people (DO X IDIOT) Played ranked: 1 normal player, 1 that lost one and ran, and 2 smurfs.  Lmao this fucking game/scene. Hope its better irl :)"
"Also going live now! More tekken 7, trying to get my fundamental 3d stuff down... And watching capcom cup!"
New YT video up! Watching Jump force get snubbed and everyone get Jebaited by nintendo at The Game Awards. Also cringe. A lot of it.
Can you restream capcom cup?
Going to try out more Tekken today! And maybe some Ultimate analysis as well :)
Oh yeah having a ton of fun with Unist! Like 6 different characters I wanna try playing :o
I actually can't believe how many people think this the reason I didn't have fun LOL. Kazumi is one of the things I do already like about the game. If I don't enjoy fundamental tekken it's not worth it to me to keep grinding :)
"Game might just not be for me but I might just also not have been in the mood/haven't learned enough. It's just has a massive learning curve and if I don't like the core gameplay it'll be hard to justify. Still, keeping an open mind and gonna do some ranked tmrw!"
"First tekken matches today, honestly didn't have a lot of fun and a lot of things aren't satisfying for me to do, but its still early. Going to give the game a few more days to see if I like it more then, currently the legacy tekken stuff and 3d stuff + meh online is making me üò≠"
"Tekken time! first time leaving the training mode and playing actual matches today, be nice D:"
also talking about granblue announcements :)
Live! Streaming UNIST and Tekken 7 today! positive vibes only :))
New Granblue characters announced! Seems like we're getting 5 more characters really quickly and then already a season 2 planned.  I'm hyped af for this game!
Had a great day today! Went üèäüèäüèä with the boys then we watched anime and forgot to play anything. 10/10
New YT video up! Showing why I'm becoming a dirty filthy G&amp;W player :v Going to be posting a lot more on YouTube again so subscribe for more silly thumbnail faces :))
what an experience that was
anyone got granblue versus footage from granblue fest? send me it alllll
can we give reggie all the awards
I just want some fucking gameplay
TSM CURRY
"""pre-rendered"""
FUCK
NO MORE HEROES :O i kinda liked the intro to the other game tho :o
Live now! Watching the game awards n chilling! lets see this DANTE starts in 13 mins!
Streaming the game Awards tonight to see Jump Force win Fighting Game of the year. Oh and the next DLC smash character or whatever
Still laughing at this one
PLAYING SOME DBFZ VS JENNIE NOW TUNE IN
*literally anything happens* People from new york:
Staying up late so I can watch the game awards tomorrow. Rough but I ll do anything to see Jump Force win Best Fighting Game of 2019
"Won't really be possible for me to compete at the top level for Ultimate this way but being the best in Ultimate is definitely not worth playing online for LOL. Hopefully I'll find a better game to compete with in 2020, hopeful for Granblue!"
"No way to be competitive in Ultimate with just offline sadly (at least not in sweden, not enough MUs and fundamentals barely matter) but inviting people over and playing is fine. Outside of DLC releases I don't think I'm ever doing a stream where I play online."
Playing offline Ultimate let me play the game for almost 4 hours before hating my life and wanting to delete the game from existence. Big improvement today.
Live now!
"Last ultimate stream for a while starting soon! Have a couple of stockholms best players over, practicing with them since they have a tournament this weekend :) Going to be playing mostly G&amp;W and Joker"
Jump Force
ty for tuning in! awesome to see everyone come support when I'm playing a new game. Going to be playing more of that and less of Ultimate :)
i'm already addicted to korean backdashes its the genes man
ok live again eating food and watching Tekken tutorial vids! then training moding with Kazumi!
deleted tweet cuz I dont want any more idiots in my mentions :)
"(to clarify, I only intended to stop competing in it before)"
Even just as a 2 hour segment ultimate online is just far too toxic to play. Thought I could endure it but it's just too bad of a game online. Going to stick to only doing offline practice/lab streams but definitely moving away from even streaming Ultimate overall.
Going to take a break and then if I feel less shitty then I'll stream some tekken. Not likely tho Ultimate has made me hate everything LMAO
"Live! A lil Ultimate, learning G&amp;W/Joker then a lil melee then a bunch of Tekken 7 learning"
If the game has a growing scene while being this hard to get into it must be pretty fkn good
Tekken is fun but VERY hard for someone new to it. Going to try to watch some vids on it tomorrow on stream.
Trying out tekken
Live now lets try this toxic ass character :)
on today's ultimate segment I will be learning Game and Watch. then I will cleanse myself with a healthy dose of Melee/tekken.
Reviewing kongo saga and mangos bday today on stream! And playing Meleeeee
I'm going to sleep gl everyone
Wew
Ok im back
:D*
Happy birthday @C9Mang0  :E
Jeeez that wario ditto
Lmao ok NVM fuck playo melee all tekken now
I wanna play melee after watching Mango s birthday sets So many games so little time
what a great game this is! blessed to be playing the ultimate fighting game for an entire year! Poggers in the comments below if you agree
rewatching Shogun vs Samsoraaaa
Streaming! chilling + watching Kongo saga stuff/Mango Bday stuff
everytime a camping jigglypuff loses i shed a tear of happiness
Ok 10th december. I will stream myself learning tekken that day! Stay tuned :)
When dors the new practice functionality come out? I wanna try tekken :)
KEN lost to a DK??? lets analyze
one year anniversary of ult streaming a little ult and watching kongo saga sets Then mby dragonball or unist
playing ft5 in dragonball now!
"unist today was fun! learned a lot about the game, and hit this combo first try :)"
UNIST DAY 3 playing offline vs @zaik_ssbm
should I?
tonight the unist continues
Unist is fun :) still need to try out new broly but gonna play more uni tomorrow!
back with more UNIST! tutorial time..?
"Streaming some UNIST! Second day of learning, playing some offline matches with @zaik_ssbm  Then melee with the boys"
"I wish 21 was actually top tier, pls season 3 make her worth playing :("
"DBFZ is fun but I really hate the current top tiers lmao, I need to find a team I enjoy so I can play a bit before Season 3 where I'll give the game a serious look again! Definitely going to stream it more tho, ty for the support!"
"very positive ultimate stream until DBFZ Broly drops, then DBFZ stream!  gonna finishing recapping Dreamhack, and maybe preview Kongo saga."
me yesterday trying to not tweet about Ultimate with all of Ultimate twitters headass takes
Unist stream was really really fun!  Happy people enjoyed watching me and Jennie play and then watch me grind combos for 4 hours LMAO def gonna stream some more at some point!
Live!
"Stream soon in 10-15, starting with the Ult move tier list then going to try learning some Unist!"
gimme a tier list for unist and a ease of use list
"going to finish my ultimate move tier list and talk a bit more about dreamhack today then do variety, maybe some UNIST trials?"
"Been watching Granblue Versus footage all morning, so hyped to grind this game!"
"Take ramen in Stockholm, new great place :D probably my favorite ramen in Sweden!"
whats the best way to show chat during a stream? is there a plugin or do people just color key it to get it transparent.
ok now im going to be nice and not tweet about ultimate for 24 hours thank you for coming cya in 2 days
"I don't personally care about my rank, people know how good I am and I've got a big presence already, but for the up and coming players from smaller regions it REALLY matters to be on the ""GLOBAL"" rankings."
Real talk: The PGR is an absolutely horseshit system Dreamhack didn't count because we had 2 people short when its Swedens biggest tournament with a ‚Ç¨5000 pot. Random US local count tho because it has more pot fodders that main Isabelle and only come there for the artist alley.
also going to go through which people are carried by PGR and why ultimate/s4 player suck stay tuned
Live! Dreamhack Celebration + Ultimate Career recap - whats next? Subgoal to rate the best of each move in Ult.
Home and about to sleeeeeep Celebration stream tomorrow
I also sadly have to stream smash 4... and maybe jump force for game awards
"Headed home from Dreamhack now, feels good to end this Ultimate arc on a win! Not going to be making any promises but in the near future my focus is not going to be on competitive ultimate.  I'll be streaming it sometimes still, but main streams are going to be Melee+variety."
"This isn't really a jab towards Ultimate community or anything, hell I don't get hype for it either, but I think I didn't truly realize just how amazing some of the other communities were and I miss being part of that."
"I feel like even if I wasn't a big fan of the game, but other people loved it and the crowds weren't dead silent most of the time, it would be much more fun to compete in Ultimate imo. Kinda like working a job you don't like but with great passionate colleagues."
"I definitely get angry and hate some parts of Melee and other games I love too, but I also have so many moments where I go ""this game is fucking sick"" and ""that was some great X game"" after a top 8.  I don't really get that much from Ultimate, and even other people don't seem to."
"""In Melee there's no chasers"" -@ArmadaUGS"
Rofl this is the shittiest tweet
Drunk I love life Always
I love  Smash Ultimate and am proud that my love of playing it competively took me to the top today!  Heart of a champion.   Send tweet
Also I feel sorry for whining like a bitch  I try to not overdo it but Ultimate just triggers me to the core. I'm generally a very happy person just very passionate about games and when I feel they suck I need to vent. I'll try to be better at it :(
Winner dinner
Dragon Ball Fighterz stream when I get back!
Leffen vs Dreamhack
When I got fucking hit by charge fsmash despite rolling in I almost pressed home and uninstalled on the spot. Was tilted for two games when his up b reverse spiked me Fucking ultimate is so badly designed maaaaan
Ultimate usually wins But today today I won over that fucking shit
How do I di vs bayo in ult?
Playing my boy rage next (Bayo) Oh joy
And ftilt jab reset cheese.
"Legit got almost no kills legit. Razor leaf uair is di able, nair up b doesnt work on di, got two edgeguards, one cuz he was stupid enough to think you can edgeguard in ult, and one due to mutlihits dropping and him getting a buffered side b. Two flame breath ftilts gimmicks"
"Gimmicked falcon so I could win despite every single 2 frame missing due to rng. Really felt like I earned that win, those mutlihits not connecting was so sick! Almost as sick as Jump Force!"
Up next vs ogey. Don't fucking let me win pleaaaase
To me its just such a fucking terrible game through and through unless you're a casual. I sincerely never feel like I earn a win and putting tons of hours in only to get camped or janked is so annoying LMAO. I thought I understood why why Zero hated competing but now I REALLY do
I can't fucking wait to be out of this tournament. I swear to god playing top level ultimate is just pure fucking torture to me.
I tried to have fun Ultimate wins again
"Trying to be positive but man ultimate makes it so fucking hard. Oh well, up next for top 8. Can't wait for this shit to be over tbh."
"Any chrom/snake/yl players who can help me warmup?  Someone tag supahsemmie lancelot and M/hudet, dont know their Twitter's :("
Playing MR R next in bracket. I'm already tilted
"Made top 8! Playing okay, gotta step it up tbh"
"After next set on stream, vs Tsun!"
Good games :D
Wawaaaaaa! Congrats!!
Any shulk/snake players at dreamhack :))?
Made it out of pools :o
Anyone got handwarmers? This venue is cold :(
I will fuel myself with pure hatred
Gonna do my best tomorrow... Despite how I'm feeling about the game its always fun to compete. One more days work then I'm freeeeee
Anyone at dreamhack with a capture card I can borrow? Willing to pay
Anyone playing at the hotels for DH? i kinda wanna stream
Just look at the fuckkng replies to these posts Smh
It really makes me understand why most top players in s4/ult are so reserved with their opinions online
"i swear to god reading twitter/twitch chat/reddits opinions about ultimate always gives me fucking cancer. The worst thing about ults shitty mechanics isn't even having to suffer through them, its the blind fanboys who can't get into elite smash who defend literally everything"
being a fighting game fan is suffering
"30 mins of ult and I'm already omegatilted LOL Airdodge to the edge is so fucking stupid to punish, so incredibly fucking inconsistent even with a perfect read with 99% of characters."
Do these fortnite zoomers even know what caramelldansen is?
Walking around Dreamhack Winter always makes me feel like so old :v I used to go to Dreamhack to play wow when I was like 13. They still play the same fucking meme songs tho
headed to dreamhack now finallyyy
im thankful for jump force
Anyone playing tonight at dreamhack? Im at elite hotel
After a subway sandwich and a cookie and fifteen tweets and a talk with @Korean808 I'm slightly less grumpy.  God bless
"Going to play Ultimate at Dreamhack since I've already booked it but past that I don't think I can take this anymore, even if it brings in money and viewers and its my job.   Sorry if it comes across as whiny but this game gets me so mad and disappointed that I'd fucking explode"
"I've tried so fucking hard to find anything to enjoy in this game but the game keeps letting me the fuck down.  I truly want to find some glimmer of hope in this shithole of a game but I just fucking can't. Guess it's just not for me, I'm honestly jealous of people who love it."
Basically every match has someone getting robbed to some bullshit and almost never do you perform something truly impressive. It's such a lose-lose game UNLESS you enjoy watching paint dry
"Some characters cheese you in different ways but in the end it all blends together. No fucking reward for doing anything remotely risky or offensive in almost any matchup, and a metric fuckton of reward for things that are basically RNG at top level."
"Basically every matchup in Ultimate boils down to the same basic and flawed shit, sh/fh aerial spam, spotdodge canceling, projectile spam, and low skill advantage states such as airdodge 50/50s or ledgetrapping.  Edgeguarding, whiff punishes, execution, reactions are gimmicks LOL"
Top level ultimate is so fucking boring
ultimate is a well designed game my multihit worked twice today!!
Can you stream from the dreamhack venue? (smash area) any TOs who can contact me? mainly thinking for tomorrow
"It's made me appreciate how much I love grinding, improving and competing, even if the thing I compete in isn't something I even enjoy much.   I still have a ton of fun with bootcamps like this in Ult too to be clear, definitely going to be hosting more bootcamps for all games!"
"Ultimate has been such mess for me, but I think I've learned a lot more about myself and learned how to get good at games I don't like or outright hate sometimes. I feel super ready to play any game now because there is simply no way I will hate it more than I hate ult online :)"
"My joker is really new still but it def has a ton of potential tho, just haaate playing him online which is my main practice :("
Gonna sleep on it. We'll see!
"They rely too much on edgeguarding in a game where most chars have insanely broken recoveries and ivy/charizard are just so fucking bad on defense.  There being less PTs now also means there's no PTs for me to analyze and steal from, sadly makes living in Sweden even worse."
"The more I play PT recently the more I think the character is overrated and not worth the effort, especially when you live in a bad region. Having to learn 3x the matchups in a game with 76 characters is an insanely bad disadvantage. Either joker main or quitting ult most likely."
"Live now! Bootcamp continues, going to talk about dreamhack and play vs @MeruSensei"
Bootcamping and improving is fun :) making a lot of progress!
Oh I will also try dragon ball fighterz when the new patch hits. Right now I still like the game but I want more character/team variety
Can't wait to take a long break from ultimate once gran blue versus comes out and hopefully play a game I like more. Melee is going to be a bigger focus as well next year. I have fun improving at ultimate but I despise it as a game so much sometimes :( so tired of camping :-:
Today was one of the roughest ultimate days in a long time LOL its been a long time since so much cheese/jank/cancer happened in my vicinity.  But slowly or surely I'm becoming resistant to the jank Or its slowly killing me not sure yet
Streams back! Playing more vs @Mr_RSmash
Playing vs @Mr_RSmash !
Playing vs @MeruSensei
Still streaming btw
Finally getting the results of my ledgetrapping practice and it feels so good to finally not suck at it anymore aaaaas
"Going live now with the bootcamp! Dreamhack practice ft Armada, Meru and Mr. R! Use !Squad to view both streams :)"
Bootcamp all dayyyy today! Hyped to practice and do some stupid shit with PT/Joker &amp; Terry!
Schleep. Cya all tmrw
EU Ultimate bootcamp is live now! Use !squad for both streams :) playing with @MeruSensei now
On the train to Gothenburg! Excited to bootcamp and go to dreamhack! But I forgot my ID at home so no partying for me üò¨
"sunday smush stream bootcamp tomorrow! Talking about that and labbing, then wow or pokemon stream :) vote jump force"
I just need to figure out what MUs I feel like I need to play joker in and get more comfortable using Arsene.
"I want to play more Terry offline but honestly he is just really, really badly made so despite him being good it doesn't feel fun to have to fight his wonky shit to do things that work perfectly fine with other chars. That said I've been really enjoying playing PT and Joker :)"
"Bootcamp next week into Dreamhack, going to be nice to compete and grind again! Bootcamp will be streamed at my and Armadas channel :)"
back  more ult then Pokemon or WOW
"Streaming! Going to practice some ult stuff, practice some new tech and do some character requests :)"
Good morning gamers Time to get to work and vote for Jump Force at the most prestigious event of the year The Game Awards Two Thousand and Nineteen!!
streaming Ultimate chill practice :)
still sick today but I'm going to be real nice and do a lil ultimate stream if this tweet gets at least ONE retweet
does ahiru no sora get good? currently the anime is aight but pretty damn basic/slow
stream is cancelled today go watch jennie instead :)
looks like we'll be having shitty online for another generation of fighting game lads
woke up with a cold today =( stream might be cancelled or at least no mic/cam
"Guys this is a matter of life and death, its a fucking awards show alright!"
"Look at these Jump Force graphics, they're almost as good as the beautiful cinematic 3FPS Wild Zone gameplay from the most profitable franchise in History, Pok√©mon! SmUsh and MK11 have absolutely nothing on this masterpiece. Vote Jump Force today for Best Fighting Game of 2019"
During today's stream I found that Terry can erase time and leap past it
Dreamhack PT/Terry practice! Offline :O
Offline Ultimate practice today :))  Starting soon!
aight its time to continue More Pokemon sword
guys I tried to pick ultimate but it buffered the wrong vote
I just cast my VOTE for JUMP FORCE. Who will you vote for? #TheGameAwards
Live with some chill ultimate Going to do some character requests online for Ult then maybe wow/pokemon
Streaming! Playing some PT today and more Terry of course :) Talking about Dreamhack and Ultimates meta developing... Then Pokemon to finish :)
ultimate time  terry practice + watching dreamhack!
Can't believe I'm watching a set where Inkling is the least toxic character on screen
"Sunday stream starting out with some chill Wow pvp, then smash then Pokemon sword! also talking about dreamhack and shit"
bro @Korean808 its time to start taking massage lessons this shield poke roller has my shoulders all kinds of stiff
Going out for lunch but then its a long boy stream day - Ult/wow phase 2 and pokemon!
Drunk
Brother I am drunn
Views
"No stream today, taking a day off :)"
Also I forgot to mention - EXP share being forced on really ruins the feeling of progression. Really don't understand that decision at all
That all said its a great chill stream game and I will keep an open mind for the rest of the game to hopefully rectify the bad start. Live in half an hourish :)
"It's still a pokemon game and it the formula still 100% works - its just that I and many others were hoping for a game better than just ""playable"" from the most profitable franchise in history."
"Obviously I haven't really gotten to the meat of the game yet (still stuck in ""tutorials""a few hours in) but I can't really recommend buying the game so far UNLESS you really enjoyed X/Y &amp; S/M. If you liked those then this is game is probably also going to be aight for you."
"Outside of that, it feels like gamefreak hasn't figured out how to make the animations and characters as charming and sleek in 3D as the earlier pokemon games had in 2D.  And the wild zone is just so badly executed - extremely laggy, camera doesn't work properly, and looks barren"
Biggest disappointment from the new pokemon games after day 1 is definitely the music. The worst arrangements  coupled with really shitty sound mixing and sound effects makes the game sound very tinny and off to me.  I expected bad graphics but I hoped music would come in clutch.
New pokemon is ugly and bad but I love streaming it LMAO cya guys in 8 hours ima nap
Its fucking time Pokemon Sword lets hope its either good or so bad its good
sword and shield stream soonish
MELEE WITH THE BOYS POKEMON SWORD/SHIELD TONIGHT
Back streaming btw! Balance Patch in 15 minutes?? also talking about how Terry is the best character in the game :)

Streaming offline terry practice today aaAAAAAAaaa my online torment is over for a few hours

Back from Food! More ult then WOW pvp
"Live now! Going to stream some Ultimate, practice and lab some terry stuff, then watch a bunch of videos/matches of terry to try to see how good he is and how he plays vs more characters!"
Anyway had a great day today outside of youknowwhat Ate tacos AND pizza Ty fot the subs and donos during stream :) Cya all tomorrow
actually unbelievable how fucking bad it is the update they didnt still doesn't even let you change stage rulesets during battle arena LOL and we fucking PAY FOR IT ASDOJASPODJ
FUUUUCK IT
FUCK ULTIMATE ONLINE
I love terry but ultimates online (which is SADLY where I get a ton of my practice from) makes him feel fucking horrible Just run into projectiles and kill moves over and over lmao BUT I will try him more offline and see if hes worth the absolute suffering he gives me online :)
sick dbfz top 8 stream soon!
broly looks sick
more terry today
My terry is getting so fucking NASTY
I love terry's fair its so fair
Live! Best terry world streaming terry training
so incredibly tired today '-'
had a great day off today did more or less the same shit but offstream felt great 10/10 degen day
every inkling when they get hit dashing right in front of their opponent
is there any frame data with terry that has frame advantage?
Even at higher percent he has uthrow into juggle or fthrow/backthrow into tech chase or death by ledgetrapping lmao
Why do people think Terry has no throw combos LOL even with DI he has stupid damage from them
"Had frontpage with Terry and reached 9k viewers :O Terry is mad fun, becoming a LOT more solid with him already :) check these two stocks!"
Offline Terry practice! Talking about new patch and Terry :o
"Offline Ultimate and Netplay melee is still a big core of course, but once I'm done with Terry I really don't think I'll be letting myself go through the torture of elite smash anymore haha."
"Going to go hard on variety streams this fall. Death stranding tomorrow and Sword N shield later, and more Wow streams once phase 2 hits! It might pay worse but I love doing them and I really don't like streaming online Ult lmao"
LIL TERRY BEFORE HAIRCUT
haircut time today gotta figure out what I wanna do watched two episodes of peaky blinders and my hair is shaking is fear
"last thoughts about patch : both happy they didnt nerf the nice top tiers and sad they didnt change any system mechanics :( feel like most ppl will be happy with the patch but yeah I guess I still had hope they'd fix Ultimates many problems :(((  tired AF now, more tMRW!"
"Will keep playing him for sure, fun character. Unfortunately ultimates terrible buffer system + bleh coding on his inputs make him really annoying to make work sometimes :("
After 10 hours of Terry: Fun character. I think we'll have to find more super setups for him to be truly consistently top tier level. Will def struggle getting out of combos and juggles but I think his recovery is fine.
Terry is mad fun and stupid But Ultimates input system/buffer + online is going to make him wayyyy more wack to play than he should be
terry is the best character in the game calling it now
PATCH IS ALREADY OUT LETS GO TERRY
Terry looks hype
direct in 10 come watch
hopes for 6.0
"Live!  Countdown to terry direct, and the 6.0 patch! Gonna be streaming all day :D"
WAIT ITS TOMORROW LOL YES IM FREE FROM ULTIMATE ANOTHER DAY
"Live! Terry direct in 30 mins, 6.0 patch and terry dropping today!? also redownloading smash ultimate........"
Stream in an hour
Right when I get out they pull me back in
smash 4 player only now
"anyway i deleted ult from my switch, fucking time to get some gear in wow"
"happiness is all about remembering and making the best out of the few good times in this dark world, because no matter how good your day or your week or your month has been, you're always just one elite smash session away from wanting to kill yourself"
"analysis starting now! tweek vs me, then dabuz vs tweek!"
"Live! Going to do a lot of analysis today, reviewing my set vs Tweek at summit and then Tweeks new Joker!"
"Going to analyze it on stream later - but god damn is the showcase just incredibly bad LMAO really feels like they didn't prep it at all, really wish they wouldve edited like Sakurais Smash showcases."
"The more I look at GG the more hype I get! The game looks fucking beautiful outside of the UI haha :o  It definitely took away a lot of ""Guilty gear"" stuff such as no throw whiff and oki loops, but personally I was never a huge fan of those so as long as it plays well Im down!"
All that said I hope I can try the new Guiltt Gear soon and obviously I will try to give detailed feedback at that point. Hopefully it won't just be playable at US/JP FGC events.
You could potentially gut the entirety of a fighting game and make it easier for casuals to get into but you risk alienating the players that have been your core audience all along (see SFV etc).  No one is going to be alienated by decent netcode or a good tutorial.
It doesn't fucking matter to my friends that try to get into Smash Ultimate that its slightly easier to short hop. What really made everyone quit that game is that the games entire online infrastructure makes you want to die.
"I want fighting games to grow and become more accessible, but the problem is devs seem to think that all that is needed is to simplify mechanics, not do proper marketing and implement systems that make people pay attention to the game and keep playing it (netcode for example)"
Yes that is the character select screen. Hopefully it's all placeholder but we really shouldn't have to hope. There's also a real chance its real sadly after BBTAGs UI
LOOK AT THIS UI WHY ARE YOU DOING MARKETING WITH SOMETHING THIS HIDEOUS
"All I'm really getting from the new GG is that FG developers still don't know how the fuck to do marketing. Excited to see more about the game but it's hard to get excited for anything before they ACTUALLY tell us about the real shit, like netcode and if that god damn UI is final"
Going live! Gonna start streaming with some Joker Online Gameplay then analyze my summit 3stock vs tweek then gear my lvl 60 mage in wow classic :)))
finally hitting lvl 60 gearing up and prepping for phase 2! wow stream
playing ultimate online and trying not to cry summit analysis set analysis and finally hitting 60 in wow :D
"Live! Gonna work a bit on my new secondary (:O), talk Terry stuff, and review more summit! expect some I told you sos and shitting on lazy players once more"
"Streaming! Finally back home, gonna go thru everything I bought in Japan, review and talk Summit and future within ULT &amp; maybe some Luigis mansion 3?"
how is luigis mansion 3? should I stream it?
hello again sweden
in moscow for a 6 hour layover and im spending it all on this TGI fridays ordering 3 orders of blue cheese burgers and playing wow with 2000 ms while listening to the most american pop playlist of all time and god its SICk
its been like 4 episodes and I just rage quit on ep 16. Ruined the entire mood of the show too. Is there an ep I can skip to?
"Like holy fucking shit how can you create such an insufferable fucking pair of characters, they make one punch man seem diverse in its jokes and they literally yell EVERY SINGLE SECOND"
"On like episode 16 of Kimetsu no Yaiba and after the first 10 or so eps were 8/10, I literally can't stand watching any episode with shitty scared guy and shitty boar guy. Do they leave or should I just drop the show?"
I hope the terry patch doesn't nerf joker otheewise he's like 99% going to be my secondary/comain! Outside of being really hard to practice online he fits me perfectly and watching @Mkleosb s joker always has me inspired haha
Also it was great working with @Korean808 at summit! We're only just getting started but I can already feel the improvements of having a second pair of eyes helping out :)
"It was a great month overall though, proud of myself for making the best of it. Did okay at Big house despite hand issues (now almost completely gone after proper handcare!) and had an awesome break in Japan. Then did decently at Summit with no Ult practice and sick af haha"
"On the way to the airport! Been a long trip, haven't really been home since before Big House... Can't wait to go back home and relax and stream chill games"
not leaving the us until tomorrow because i woke up too late and missed my flight :O rip summit winnings
I love life
I'm drunk but i love life
Who got alcohol and is tryna get LIT
Mafia is a sick game btw no hard feelings lmao people think we're actually livid
This is the first handle... Ultimate players don't know how to party SMH @C9Mang0
Where is hot bid when you need him
Cheating and teammates sucking aside I think the rules were insanely in favor of town because of infinite nominations. A ruling so bad Slime only let it rock one day but it still was enough to kill D1 lmao
"No way town is winning like 98% of the games when theyre this bad, someone is def cheating"
"Light is a cheater like 99% sure lmao Also D1 and dabuz are actual throwers. D1 did the worse defence of all time and somehow thought Slep wasn't cop, and dabuz was completely silent (unlike himself) and was the vote that killed D1......."
"AF* still like the game overall, just not in a double elim bracket format :)"
Also now that I've beaten a top player can I just state Ult is still a shitty competitive game LMAO fuck 76 characters with 66 being toxic ar
"Live from summit! Talking my bracket run, being the pokemon master and more!"
"Happy how I played in bracket all things considered! Definitely stepped it up with the exp from pools. Sad I missed a couple key conversions vs Light but still, I played well! Out at 9th"
Sad for tweek tho :(  knew hes gonna comeback way stronger!
LETSFUCKINGGOOOO
"Live from my hotel room :O Talking summit so far, watching skits/sets and talking mafia! come chill"
Anyone playing tonight? At summit hotel
WOo thats a good one in the books
"Never played with Mars before so it was hard to get a read, and I was blinded by friendship :( NEVER AGAIN üò°"
Awww good plays
Feels good to be back in Mafia
"That said I know I can play a lot better than I have been, my ledge trapping and punish still isnt back to as good as it was post mainstage so if I can get that back with a bit less rustiness/sickness and implement the things I've learned I can definitely do muuuuch better."
"Hope y'all enjoyed the commentary! Gonna try to play a round or two of mafia before grinding more, trying to get my fans their money's worth in case I lose to tweek tomorrow and end up 0-5 :V"
Played like alright vs Marss but he is just way better than me at that MU! Felt like I know exactly what to work on just didnt do it in time for the set :)
Anyone got tips vs zss/marss? :))
Also please fix Zards hurtbox and up b :(
loser plays loser of Tweek/Leo.  Damn summit üòÖ
"Also Tea had practiced saying ""it is an honor to play you"" in english so he could say it before our set ;-; thank you and good games!"
"Next up is Marss, another player that's super scary vs PT. I got a little ZSS practice so I'm gonna do my best!"
Ahh didn't take any sets but happy with how I played overall all things considered. Learned a lot!
Tea is so nuts man Anyone got PT vs Pacman tips?
Tea is up next! Haven't ever played a single decent pacman but I've tried to study vods so I'm excited to see if I can take some games. Either way itll be sick exp.
"First tournament set tho so its not a big deal results wise - its all for seeding anyway. That said I really gotta learn to manage having less energy than usual, not sure how to but I know there's a way!"
Ahh Nairo is so good at that MU! Didn't play nearly good enough to keep up with the fast pace and dropped tons of things I needed to get my own stuff going. Sad but ggs!
"Playing my pool and first round of bracket today, gonna be hard af but I'm gonna try my best to pull off an upset or two! Either way its invaluable exp for sure :) Still feeling sick somehow but at least not as bad as yday so I'm hopeful."
Definitely going to work on a secondary after the Terry patch. PT is good but they have a couple matchups like rob shulk oli etc that are require you to play perfectly which isn't really practical for tournaments
Does anyone play Palu at summit? Even a shitty one :O
"New haikyuu arc has me excited, haiykuu has always been a solid high school volleyball anime but I feel like it can hopefully be something more than just solid if they pull of this one."
I swear I'm gonna catch up any fuckin second and ull be regretting this :)
The buyins grind like 3x harder than the players here at Ult summit lmao Ult players are addicted to the mafia grind
Gotta steal the vote strats from @Hot_Bid  So powerful for baiting people and convincing people to trust u
Does anyone at summit play Palu Pacman or sheik?
Now that I'm feeling the worst When everything is lost When I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel You are my guiding star
Great job team
"Not playing in the Ping pong battle, feeling worse than yday so feels like its better to rest."
"Still in my hotel room, woke up feeling worse than yesterday :( going to try and head to Summit soon but still feeling bad :((("
Leos marth side b killed me at 20
Marth is broken in Ultimate too
More grind streams tomorrow! Gonna try to get really good footage to study :)
Fuck mafia why do I always die early skfjsojdf
Paper plane lord streaming from Summit! Gonna play some top players on stream :)
"Did some commentary, now my voice is gone. Hope u guys enjoyed :0"
"Playing lame is unfortunately rewarded in most modern fighting games, generally because of trying to make things more newbie accessible, so learning to play more lame is really really useful for my career long term. I hope the big games wont be as insanely defensive as Ult tho"
"Ya boi is getting lamer too though, been interesting trying to kill my inner desire to play fun and cool and just play lame and clean as fuck 99% of time and then approach once every year or so"
"In ultimate you don't get rusty execution wise since buffer, you just lose your built up acceptance of all the lame bullshit. Been a rage inducing time here at summit so far, everyone's getting more and more and more defensive every day LMAO"
"(i just like adaptation over variety, prefer regular matches where that is more emphasized, its completely fine to like variety tho)"
wew didn't do too bad  Fucking hate squad strike as a format but I also understand why others like it lmao
Squad strike single elim today Up vs esam first Top voted comments decides my lineup One char per tweet
Ahhh i need another hit
only time i feel okay during this plague is when i talk about weeb shit Is this sickness actually just my body going through Japan withdrawal?
"gonna try this twitch thing again to see if i still have it talking about media day, japan trip, and all the CRAZY SUMMIT SKITS IM IN (hint: not a single one, for the 3rd summit or so in a row LMAO)"
Which characters have different ledge standup frames in ultimate? I know GAw has one
looking at this again i cant believe how much Instagram filters/selfie cam effects make me look not like garbage ROFL Gonna post this to that one instagram reality reddit
My eyes look like 10x more red irl Keep that in mind im an up n coming kakashi cosplayer Pls support my patreon
"This Summit is crazy stacked! Really happy with the round robin format, I really need the practice :o Gonna try to make the most of the event without collapsing :O"
"if one player lost really bad a ""I gotta have @n3zModGod take a look at my controller"" is proper etiquette"
"Meanwhile each good long melee session ends both parties exhausted, drained but ultimately grateful and with more respect and love for each other than before knowing that they both witnessed a small miracle take place. A kiss on the mouth follows with a promise to play more later"
"i feel like most ultimate sessions just end with both people walking a way quietly, more scarred and further disgusted by each others character.  And a subtweet by the person who lost majority"
im gonna go cough on every bayo player
"In all seriousness big shoutouts to summit for taking care of me, they're doing their best to help me out, wouldn't bother getting out of bed for any other tournament :)"
My hotel roommate even got a new room just to avoid me :( Armada I thought we went way back üò≠
"Ultimate summit so far has been so hostile!! I just go: hey whatsup guys how yall been? And they all respond with:  ""Wow you look like shit"" ""Leffen you look miserable"" üò°"
ud think that cuz im a weeb id like wearing face masks but NO These things make you feel even more sick Just breathing your own hot air over and over
Going to be hard getting anyone to play friendlies with me since everyone is afraid of getting sick lmao. For 200 twitch primes I will cough on your most hated top player üòè
if anyone has meds and shit who can bring it tomorrow pls do :) willing to try anything below morphine to feel better
god i feel fucking terrible been trying to rest all day and nothings working media day early tomorrow halfway to the grave aesthetic will have to work
Arrived at hotel Not sure if I should try to rest or try to derust in Ultimate... Feeling terrible but also feeling terribly rusty Ajdjksldld
Going to try to rest today but I'm seriously bummed out to be this sick when people spent so much money to get me into summit. Jennie has the same shit and she's still sick and hers started like 3 days earlier :8
"Landed in LA! Stupid fucking flu, I was always either sweating or freezing, while constantly coughing and while not being able to breathe through my nose x_x Legit feels like I caught the fucking plague"
Japan has been fucking great Ready to take on the world again
Part 3: flight time to go to summit! Haven't played any Ult since Mainstage so once I land its time to derust like crazy!... Hopefully without a fever :(
i am fuckin dying to the flu btw but at least it makes it easier to justify expensive purchases
step 2: fashion Gotta go home and start saving up save for next year now üò≠ Omw to the airport as well!
"Step one: food! Tsuta Ramen, was amazing :)"
fighting a rainstorm and the flu to get my food fashion and my flight Pray I make it
Whats the easiest way to get some meds in japan? And whats the name of their advil lmao
Got the flu I think :( first time being this sick in a long time and it had to happen when im traveling to summit :|
"big thanks to all my friends, fans and family who got me here and keeps me going this :))"
just chilling with some coffee and thinking about how fucking amazing this trip was and how grateful for everything. very happy :)
"Feels really weird to be traveling all on my own again, even if its only for a day. Not bad tho, it's really lets you immerse yourself."
"One more full day in Japan! Going to try to get the Michelin star ramen, some stupid expensive sushi and drown myself in consumerism and then go back to farm dire maul on my undead mage  itll be fucking glorious"
but I think this place is too wholesome in the long run for a sick masochist like myself  Im a fox player till the day i fuckin die
Don't let me go back man I wanna stay in the world of japanese food and fashion not the world where Jigglypuff carries you Give me more onigiris not more Ultimate online
I wake up to that on my last day in Japan. Lmao guess its time to go back to the harsh reality.

"trying my hardest to not answer business emails/requests while im japan btw, ill be fully reachable after japan+summit!"
Typhoon seems to be more or less over at our area!
Anyone got tips to running Faster Melee smoothly on the newest macbook pro? (Asking for @aidencalvin &amp; @boxrZhu )
Got a bunch of food and drinks stocked up. Gonna be spending the next two days chilling with everyone inside :)

The boys To Japan
"Regardless of some issues, many of them issues of tournaments in general, Big house was a step up from last year and I had a good time competing in melee! Happy to see everyone enjoyed the games :)  Let's make work together to make TBH10 even better :)"
Heavens feel movie 2 was a lot better than the first. What an animation budget :o Gotta wait a year for next one now tho or read the vn :(
"For example, giving streamers/top players a coupon code that I can shout out eg. ""register for genesis with x code"" and then I get a cut of entry, letting us be a part of merch/compendium stores (play a bo5 with this player at this timeslot for $20)   etc etc!"
That's why I think it's important that at least entry is raised a bit for now - because I don't actually believe TOs will get off their asses and start working with top players until they see it hurt their bottom line.  There are a TON of ways both parties can support eachother!
"It's incredibly hard for top players to actually know the solution to this, because in general top players aren't given any information or way to communicate with TOs, even when it comes to something as basic as not running obviously terrible schedules."
"That's why I say that TOs need to be willing to actually work with top players. Ideally you want as many people to be able to go to an event as possible, and keep further support optional while still making some of it actually go to competitors.  RN merch sales etc all go to TOs"
"To be clear I don't think anything really is solved by raising the entry 5 or 10 dollars, but I do think its a decent first step since venue fees have gone up a TON  while entry has stayed the same or lowered since before.  The ideal solution is more complex for sure."
Also I missed the opportunity to use this picture LOL Press F for my hands @spotdodge_shine
"Flying back now.  Break time, going to be posting mostly on Instagram while in Japan. Going to recharge and try to be ready again for Ultimate summit.  Sorry for the lack of streams, appreciate those who stay subbed :)"
really @KLM cancelled my flight from Amsterdam to Stockholm... And now I have to fly from Amsterdam to Helsinki and then to Stockholm   yayy
Even commentators get paid more than most of top 8 and often gets flights covered to majors. That's not to say that commentators should be paid less but far less people attend/watch an event because a commentator is there than top players attending.
Honestly top players should unionize but it won't realistically happen. If TOs aren't willing to work with top players you will see more people attend less and less as soon as their stream/twitter grows big enough. With how awful schedules and payouts are - who can blame them?
get this man a sponsor And please let top players stop getting ripped off by tournaments. We provide a HUGE chunk of the attendees and viewership and see basically nothing of that.
"going to go live with a lil hotel stream last stream of this month maybe?? going to talk about Big house, Japan, and how top players are being completely fucked by current tournament structures :)"
reading latest haikyuu chapter  this is a big mood
Also someone covered mine and @PG_Zain &amp; @misstolkien s dinner last night anonymously Big flex Ty!
"Feeling a lot better today! Lost in an ultra shitty way, but at least I lost to my two good friends @PG_Zain &amp; @C9Mang0  who have both played way more melee this year so they really deserved the win 100%.  Hope everyone enjoyed the matches and congrats Mang &amp; @Ssb4_Zackray"
Nvm 4:30
Flight leaves at 6:50 PM If anyone wants to play a bit of melee or ult lmk
I got third and it doesn't even cover my flight and hotel. If not for TSM I would've lost money on this trip. Still lost a fuckton because my stream suffers but yeah
Increase entry. This fucking pathetic for a stream that reached 90k.
Safe to say that I'm going to make some serious life changes because I can not take another week like this. Anyway GZ mango LOL
"Honestly I shouldn't have gone to Big house considering everything but I did and I got through it. Feeling a bit better now, so I thought I'd be open about how I felt. I know people will see this as just johns but I really don't mean it to be. Showing emotion is not a weakness."
"To be clear, my hands have consistently gotten better after starting to take care of them, until being forced to play in a freezing venue for 11 hours straight. It's just that along with burnout and my entire life kinda depending on them it was hard not to be really depressed."
My mind went to some really fucking dark places because of everything. I had several nightmares every night and was exhausted constantly despite sleeping enough. To then have to deal with random shit like forgetting my tsm jersey and bad scheduling was incredibly fucking hard.
"Thinking back on it, this has probably been my been the roughest week of my life and I'm so fucking happy its over. I was extremely stressed during Summit campaigning, and then went straight into cramming for Big House while being really scared and depressed about my hands -"
"Anyway even tweeting hurts so fucking much so I think thats god telling me that I should stop lmao. Enjoy GFs, cya all next event!"
Really proud of myself though despite the really sad ending. Everyone close to me told me not to go to Big house due to burnout + hand issues but I feel like I still had a decent showing despite that. If my hands are permanently fucked then well... Going to rest up in Japan now.
Just sad more than salty. This schedule and these matchups were the absolute worst possible for me. Tried my best and had a good mentality and knew what to look out for but after winner semi's I couldn't even play a decent match because of hand pain. Just really unfortunate :(
Hand went completely numb right before the set. Thought about fortfeiting since I knew I couldn't win two sets in grands but it wouldve been a terrible way to end the tournament. Ggs to mango and zain. I finally get to rest.
1 or 3 sets till my hands can rest. Pls don't break.
How do I bring this back with my hands compelety fucked. Send memes to cheer me up
Lmao what a set. Zain played good! Not sure if its possible to win that MU if he does but I shall try
Any marth players?
I hereby officially declare Rfang to not be a memepick
"Me rn after playing straight from 9AM with no breaks and only fast matchups and only fast MUs left too In a cold venue  Too late to drop out, gonna have to do the best I can"
Hey anyone got caffeine? Energy drink sugarfree pref
Plup beat Salem THOO
Bro that combo
Any sheiks who can help me practice?? In the vip room atm
Any foxes who can help me warmup
Beat Tai 3-1. Dropped game one but stayed calm despite getting gimped and 0 to death and won 3 straight.
Thank god
welcome back jason
Only thing more depressing than playing marth fox is watching marth fox LMAO
so I went to bed at 9PM and woke up at 7AM to warm up since I was told I had to play at 11AM. Get here and I get told its at 1PM cant fucking wait to go to japan.
anyone at the venue for melee?
This + freezing venue... i can't wait to go to Japan...
"this schedule is so fucking weird Played 4 sets in two days, and now tomorrow at 11am we are running top 64 straight into top 8. Going to be at least 6 sets to win through winners..."
"Not to mention my hands. They hurt WAY more when I play in a cold environment, feeling super fkn stiff now :("
Honestly we got no fucking chance to beat the floaties if the venue doesn't get warmer. I'm using like 3 pairs of handwarmers and it doesnt even last thru the first stock. Turn up the temperature to save melee pls
Beat Nakamaman and Peanutphobia 2-0 and 2-0 - played solid despite venue being freezing cold. Really hope its warmer tomorrow.
"Melee is really fun tho, had a good time playing today despite feeling rusty, which I usually can't manage . Hands are kinda fkd tho, itll be a really rough event for me.  At least there's a light at the end of the tunnel, Japan on wednesday... Just gotta hold out."
If any fox still has faith in this matchup... I don't even wanna hear it at this point ur all delusional LMAO
"Sheffen or Marthffen is gonna have to make some moves next year, esp if M2K keeps playing"
Sometimes I wish I could go back to the good old times when I still believed Marth Fox to be only 6-4
Is there anyone with handwarmers at Big house? Willing to buy at a good price
"i need to fly out earlier to majors, the first two days of any major is just me alone in a hotel room, fighting jetlag and extreme exhaustion with expensive delivery food and youtube top 10 vids"
just woke up again anyone got advil
whos up early and wants to play
Its 3am and I just woke up Rip
"To be clear, Korean will not be giving me Melee specific coaching, but obviously having another person available is still a great help and let's me focus on the game.  I will be looking for a Melee specific ""analyst"" for myself after Big House though."
America hello I am tired
Super excited to have @Korean808 on board! He helped me out a lot during Mainstage and it'll really help me to have someone experienced to help me out in Ultimate :)
My hands have less pain today than yday so I will be going to Big house!  Hyped to play despite everything.  Keep in mind that if hand pain gets worse again I will not risk my career over one major. Doing everything I can on that front.
deleting tweets because people literally cant read and i dont wanna deal with people that stupid good night
of fucking course im gonna burn myself out if I do all 3 i am an actual idiot
"like why im so stupid there's extremely few people who can live in europe and be a top player in any fighting game, even those with actual good scenes in EU. there's few people even in the US that both stream full time and compete at top level  and i do both AND play ult LOL"
if only netcode was better for fgs if only more people watched twitch during eu hours if only i could stand to live in america if only europe was better at fighting games :(
"i feel like because i live in such a bad region for streaming/competing i try to make up for it by working harder than anyone else, but i feel like i need to accept that it's just gonna take me longer and be harder and not push myself too hard, because it just ends up backfiring"
"this winter I will stream a lot tho since there's less tournaments, but maybe more chill streams and less practice streams"
"next year I will be focusing more on competing and less on streaming, since this year was the opposite.  feels like I'm good enough now in ult where I can justify focusing on competing in it rather than streaming it  will obv be playing melee and still stream tho, just less"
"i seriously need to work less  i cant keep doing 3 full time jobs at once, esp with two off them requiring constant overseas travel.  gonna try to somehow hold my burnout at bay until after big house"
Melee practice!
aight boys VOTE SANDSTORM LETS GO
man i unblocked esam as a summit votein goal can I take that back if I play 2 hours of smash 4?
WOOO summit is saved
Summit celebration + Big house melee practice! Next votein happening soon! and I got 900 votes to spend üëÄ
who wants to grind melee today in europe? puff/marth/falco/falcon esp
"(obviously i will not play if I think it'll seriously harm them for the future, but I have a 2 week break after Big house in Japan so I think I'll be able to manage)"
"(nothing too serious, just too much ultimate and no proper handcare because I'm a idiot - gonna try to manage them so I can play at TBH)"
"Woke up today feeling like I just got home after a super major.  Now I gotta go actually prepare for big house every single hour I got.  I just hope my hands hold up, its looking like theyre gonna limit my ability hard this weekend :("
"Huge thanks to everyone who supported me during the Summit campaign! Feels unreal to receive this much support, took a lot of energy from myself and a lot of people who helped organize it.  Going to rest up and make the most out this opportunity!"
WAIT NO
9 MINUTES LEFT LETS FUCKING DO THIS
ROACH ROACH ROACH
LOL
free food and drinks as well
"Summit voting pushes a man to its limit. Makes you do things you'd never think of before. Eat disgusting things, do unthinkable deeds. I don't think I'll be able to look myself in the mirror tonight.  I'm sorry. Please vote me for summit."
If theres anyone who is still intereted in buying a Buyin pass for summit and getting a deal (a big chunk of it for free) let me know!
"Live! 13 hours left before Round 1 of Summit, going to be streaming all the way until then. New giveaways and new incentives announcing now! HELP ME"
whats the best way to do sub giveaways?
its 7am i just woke up summit stream soon
if I don't get into summit I will stop posting cute cat pictures My twitter will lose its heart Vote now
practicing melee talking summit what else
I'm sorry mom I'm sorry dad  I'm sorry @TSM
I've realized skill legacy personality all this mean nothing in the Summit voting. When my rivals are eating roaches and dog shit milkshakes - I have to step up my game.  So if I get into summit I will commit a horrible act  I will stream 1 hour one Hour of Smash 4 for the Wii U
"Streaming! Starting out with some Summit talk,  gonna reveal my one SHOCKING Incentive that I will do if I get in!!! WOW then melee practice the rest of the day"
here in melee we thought chu dat eating onions was bad  the zoomers are coming for us old melee heads
apparantly rfang is having people eat cockroaches to get summit votes  jesus fuckin christ I got no chance
"Everyone on that list has likely a fuckton of votes saved up to drop at the last second tomorrow, so just because Esam is techinically behind doesn't mean he is in reality.  Right now I would say my chances of getting in tomorrow are 40%ish, so we still need a lot more votes!"
"I hope people realize that just because I'm a big name/known player that doesn't mean that my chances of getting in are bigger than anyone else. These guys have entire scenes and in Sandstorms case, even a game developer behind them, all willing to drop serious cash."
"and just like that we lost the lead :O summit is crazy competitive this time, we need every vote we can get! A lot of people have free votes so check out the link and see if you have any :)"
"If you are planning on voting for me, please join the discord so we can organize it in the best way possible, and message one of the mods there once ur in :) And huge thanks to everyone who's helping out!"
I'm not gonna cosplay or do something stupid if I get in so I don't have that much swing BUT  I promise that if I do get in then I will use the opportunity to practice my ass off and make god damn sure I'm invited next time so I don't have to campaign.  And also fuck ppl in mafia
Summit voting is so fucking stressful man. I know everyone has crazy sugar daddies in their camp waiting to drop tons of votes on the votein on Monday too. Had no time/energy to practice for Big House melee today since I was campaigning all day :( Really hope I get in.
"Talking Summit (3 ppl get eliminated in 1 hour!) and rewatching/analyzing mainstage, and then melee practice for Big house!"
If there's anyone who is looking to buy a VIP pass for Summit and wants a deal msg me here or on discord! If you're a top player who can't afford it by yourself but you can get to the event and chip for a bit of the pass as well we could also prob work something out lmk :))
"If you have votes that you're willing to spend on me for summit, please join the spirit bomb discord so we can organize dropping them together :) Super big thanks to everyone who's helping out, I really REALLY wanna go to summit so thank u thank u :)"
PT Matchup chart time
"SUMMIT SELLOUT PLAYS ULTIMATE talking summit, mainstage and shit then melee practice for big house!"
Stream soon!
new twitch is quite the thing
Summit voting is live! Consider dropping your vote on the salem slayer :)
bye america see u soon for big house
so kkbqd out of my mind lax next
"Summit voting is stacked :O Gonna be really hard to get in, 3 europeans and I don't think I have any big boy sugar daddies like some :("
"Not gonna be able to play Ult for a bit so wanted to make sure I implemented a lot of what I learned yday before it slipped.  Made very good progress, already way better than yday :)"
Grinded a cool10 hours or so today with @ArmadaUGS despite telling myself  to take it easy since played 12 hrs yday. Good practice but man I'm banning myself from playing smash for two days this aint healthy
Are you really okay with a world where this PT isn't at Summit?
Whats the easiest ways to get the raw video file from a twitch clip
"I've decided to opt in to summit.  Going to campaign a decent amount but nothing stupid, no cosplay &amp; no onion shakes.  You guys know what I bring to the table. Vote for me if you want that in Summit, if not, spend them on someone else.  If I get in I will team with @TweekSsb"
I nominated @TSM_Leffen for @BTSsmash #UltimateSummit2    via @smashgg
whos going to MSM Today? Might go if its stacked and im not tired
"Streaming! gonna recap mainstage, talk opting in to summit (?), Nintendo banning Hero and more!"
Stream?
I got a lot to learn still but I feel like I'm almost almost there for Ult. Just a bit more tournament/MU exp and then a bit more practice against top players and I can make top 8s I think
"Gonna try to focus more on analysis and offline practice for ult, and practice a few matchups online in short burst in order to not let online make me worse. I think talking to more people about what I need to improve in Melee is important too."
"No party for me, just played more Ult. After grinding it out and talking about the game with top players I feel like I have a really solid understanding on what to work on now.  TY everyone for the games and tips"
What are people now? Party?
Gz @NairoMK !
that said playing Ult also makes me play melee cuz this game is so ass in some areas melee is godlike in lmao
"I don't know if there's any real solution to this, maybe I'm wrong about how broken Jiggs is but honestly every single time I play or analyze Jiggs I become more and more convinced that Jigglypuff is even better than I initially thought."
"Even tho I'm amazing vs Jiggs its really fucking hard still, and I have to go through a bracket where usually, everyone is amazing vs fox.  Traveling 20hrs, shitty tournaments, arduinos and knowing that if I lose to anyone then Jigglypuff winning the tournament is very likely."
"People keep asking me why I keep playing Ult. Honestly Melee Jigglypuff is honestly half the reason that I play Ultimate. It's not even only how broken she is and how boring it is to watch, its knowing that almost every good player sucks vs Puff or plays a 7-3 MU."
JFC LOL
lmao I love the roasts
"Really wish there was a practical way to limit Puffs camping better. LGL helps a little but sadly puff gets a free win on 80% of the good chars by just getting a small lead, in the most boring and degenerate way lmao. I feel so bad for everyone playing those chars :("
man jigglypuff is so fucking broken LOL
know that i'm coming for u  lazy bitches
I know that in time the work I put in will show when everyone else who is blessed with top tier practice is slacking off and wasting it. It will just take a while and I gotta stay patient.
I need to accept that getting good in a worse region with almost no offline practice is going to take time when everyone else that does really well in Ult has better offline practice and played smash 4.  For Ult tournaments saving energy is more important than warmup too.
"really motivated again which is nice, but I played too much today and I'll probably be very tired for a few days again. I keep wanting to grind 12+ hours a day when I'm in the US to make up for how bad my practice at home is but I overcompensate and end up burning myself out"
"gonna grind a ton of ult/melee tomorrow, maybe even do money matches and enter the $10 brackets. Or I'm gonna stay in and play wow all day. Only god knows"
When do the $5/$10 brackets for ult start? i wanna play some more tournament sets
Gonna be focusing on Melee now but I'm too stubborn to stop playing Ult before I perform at least once like I know I can.
I know I've gotten a fuckton better at Ult since Smashcon but I just haven't been able to show much of it. Hope I make it to Summit so I can.
And your teammates is your region. Living in Sweden is like having a fucking Legion Commander jungling on your team
Improving at Ultimate is like improving in a moba for people that didn't play S4 lmao. You can never expect to do well every tournament/match because sometimes shit is just out of your control. The important thing is to win every time you do get and stay positive when you get BSd
Let the record show I shook Salem's hand. That guy is fucking pathetic LMAO
Isn't*
"Still 17th is too bad for how burned out I've been, but I'm really sad about the two sets I lost. Gotta work on the consistency but man its rough when I get so few chances to practice and perform compared to everyone else and then I lose the one matchup I had a bit of practice in"
"Nicko is great though don't get it twisted, just fucking salty I played terrible"
Really frustrating to lose in a MU I actually knew but coming back from buffer SDs in this game is so fucking hard :(
"Played absolutely terrible vs Nicko, SDd every game I lost :( lost 3-1"
Beat Dakpo 3-0! Played super well;
Beat Puppeh 3-1! He won game 1 playing really well with Zard and then I started going in with Squirtle after game 2 and he started playing worse. Playing Dakpo next
Snake/PT players pleaaase where are you
Playing loser of Salem/Puppeh next... If theres any snake or PT players please let me know :0
Beat Kantrip 3-0! Beat diddy solidly game 1 and 3 stocked game 2 so he went Swordfighter game 3. Was down for a bit and then adapted and won.
Anyone who plays mii swordfighter/diddy/pt/snake here who can help me warmup?
If anyone knows my bracket path and what MUs they are pls let me know!
Also can we ban flipkick i want my opponent to have to play disadvantage
Playing better! Still got cheesed by bthrow flipkick despite telling myself to avoid it before lmao. Knew beforehand that this was a learning tournament so reminding myself of that helped a decent amount as well.
I definitely need more tournament exp in Ult! People play differently in tournament and I have some shitty online habits that don't come out in friendlies. Hoping I can make it a fair bit in losers so I get some of that exp
GGs! Frustrating to play so low energy and meh but thats how it is. Can't beat myself up for it. Gonna try to step it up in losers but it'll be hard!
"Spend that energy supporting those  that do enter and put time instead.  I do really hope its get better, and I honestly think if the TOs can't agree to some kind of circuit that it will be rough for melee moving forward since it would fix a ton of the problems we have RN"
"I completely understand the people who are mad or frustrated that people are dropping out of melee, trust me, I really wish it was better (and that I could enter) but flaming those who've the majority of  their life on/for the game is not the way to go."
good stuff @Matthewmatosis :)
this video and its newly released sequel might just be my favorite 2 videos on youtube heavily recommended if you're into game analysis
"melee is going to be the big priority at every double game major though, but I will try to go to a few ult only events and make it to ult summit as long as I feel like I won't be burned out.  Gonna be taking it slow and steady but i'll get there."
"In general taking it very easy this event has let me enjoy it more as well, happy I didn't stay home like I almost did. The event being ran well and less crowded (so far) helps too. Entering 2 games is just too much man, never entering both at a major again."
Small chance I play sheik for exp in melee
"If I can have energy enough to enter tomorrow and avoid dying at 60% a little bit more I think I can do well in Ult. Brackets rough af but I've been playing well. Melee is looking like its RIP, not gonna risk it cuz my hands are on the edge of starting to hurt. Big house tho üò©"
Legit the best venue and best amount of setups I've seen at a major this year... Lets just hope it runs well tomorrow and sticks the landing
Mainstage is really nice so far :0
who is tryna play
i think the real reason im burned out is not competing at top level in 2 games on another continent while also trying to stream 10 hours 7 days a week. the real reason is that i havent been watching enough sports anime lately
burnout sucks but im finally at the point where im not beating myself up for it anymore :)  going to be taking it very easy for this event and practice for big house.  people will obviously be toxic about this but I know the real ones know whats up so who gives a shit
When does the venue open tomorrow? Headed to hotel now
someone gimme a screenshot of ivy and squirtle trip animation
I am so hungry i am dying
Bro I am still in the first part of customs Rip
Just landed in LA :o
"oh ya the different heros are different levels of rng from amazing (crit on every relevant smash attack, always zoom when recover, magic burst when ledge trapping, zoom when recovering) and no luck (doesnt press down b, 1/8 crits)"
YT video maybe if my editor stops being dead @Jampanos163
full tier list everything esp lower is very loosely ordered in general this game doesn't have big gaps in power so no character is bad and its often more important to play a MU you know than a MU you win
Finally fucking finishing my tier list doing S tiers now
Chill Wow stream then finishing Ult tier list Leaving for Mainstage early tomorrow lets talk and chill for a bit before then
Leffen vs Trif in melee
Squirtle is such a good boy
melee
streaming more grinding
mainstage practice in melee/ult no promises
"(after I rest up from sickness/burnout btw, this is not for mainstage)"
played some netplay melee today tho and damn melee is good i should play it more
"its really annoying honestly, i cant get any good practice at all with PT since you can't play him correctly at all. If I was super duper serious I'd honestly have to switch to a char that functions online since thats where  I get most of my practice but nahh ult aint shit w/o PT"
legit his only usable move is side B LOL
honestly squirtle is so fucking useless online  might be the single character that jumps the most in tier going from online to offline. offline he fucking carries PT LOL
black kkklansman was good but a lot more depressing than I thought itd be
it infuriates me that i'm getting stressed out by such literal fuckheads but it is what it is. gotta accept that I'm human and put less on my plate.
"honestly feeling like im right on the edge of burning out. havent even been playing that much but the ultimate community, both on stream and on reddit is stressing me out way more than I expected. Still going to the US tomorrow for Mainstage but likely to not enter anything."
"Mainstage !Grind, Tier list finishing tonight starting ult then melee"
schedule has them both at the same time so not able to enter both. maybe ill be more open when the online community is less fucking toxic
"got no actual idea what game I wanna play at mainstage tbh got a lot of personal shit and personal reasons to figure out before this weekend, not going to tell details because the online smash community is so fucking toxic tho. gonna try to figure it out."
and im not talking about mid level players that tryhard for 1 month and then stop so dont ask :)
even thinking about practicing ultimate in europe makes me sad... really hope people start becoming more motivated with the european nintendo circuit because we need more people that put in the work. 100% ready to fly out and bootcamp with those people that show that drive.
"A little late but man, the bootcamp was great, thanks @GlutonnySSB @MeruSensei and @ArmadaUGS for the practice and tips! Definitely going to do this again.  extremely depressed now tho because I have to go back to online practice again :("
"This is a good excuse to put more focus on health and exercise though. i've been getting some routines down for a bit now which is good progress, but its time to step it up. Got a cold now tho so not now *_*"
"The article is an interesting read btw, ive always felt like intense sets/practice was physically draining but everyone said I was trippin lmao"
now if only tournaments planned schedules to allow players to eat :)
"Live! FINALLY finishing my tier list, talking campaigning for Ult summit and chilling with some Banjo/PT online"
Live again! Last day of EU Bootcamp! Going to do my Tier list today as well :)
Legit very excited to have access to this kinda space. Tsm baby :)
pOG
LeffLounge Bootcamp live again! Gonna play vs Gluto and talk about shit
going to do some tryhard grinding vs @MeruSensei  on my stream! Gluto vs Armada on his stream as well :)
really good practice today :D
playing vs @MeruSensei !!!
Live with the EU BOOTCAMP! Got @ArmadaUGS @MeruSensei and @GlutonnySSB over for a few days to grind for the upcoming Nintendo European Smash Circuit! Gonna be talking about the announcement as well too!
"Going live now! Day 0 of the Ultimate EU bootcamp, @ArmadaUGS is here and @MeruSenseiis coming soon!  (glutonny coming tmrw)"
feeling rusty but also hella motivated to playmelee going to be playing it like 10 hours a day after the ult bootcamp!
TIER LIST TIME! 5.0
"LIVE! Doing my 5.0 Ultimate tier list, talking about the Bootcamp tomorrow and then playing some good ol melee"
I hope the bootcamp next week etc will change my mind tbh! if not we wait for granblue and gg and riot fg and stream and play melee until then
maybe this'll change but if I make it into Ult summit I think it's probably time for me to quit and try to find more people like me in another scene. I'm honestly just afraid that the next scene will be just the same.
"I think it's just me not fitting into Ultimate's scene at all. I honestly just feel this disconnect to 99% of the scene who all play purely for low effort fun - ""ill play a good char as long as its my waifu!!"" Nothing wrong with that either, just wish I had more likeminded peeps"
"obviously I would love for there to be more money in the scene, but I never think it should be the main reason why anyone tries to get good at smash. Those people would rarely if ever stand a chance at making that money vs people who are truly driven anyway TBH"
"""whats the point of practicing if there's not going to be any big majors for me to go to"" its not techinically wrong, but it's so alien to me. all these people have 0 intristic motivation to actually better themselves and do it all for the money and fame? playing smash? for money"
The sad part of this is not how hard it is for me - I've played DBFZ in similar conditions and Melee in even worse ones. I'm fine with it being harder. The sad part is that every god damn ult player from europe excuses their shitty habits &amp; their lack of discipline with it
"yeah seems like there isn't really anyone doing too well with little no wonder really, Ultimate seems like the most scene dependent game of late. The number of matchups + the bad online + the casualness of the avg competitor means that good practice is broken AF"
what are the best players for ultimate that don't live in a good scene? preferably if they werent also top smash 4 players
they all want tips to improve but almost noone wants to change
the amount of people who actually play good characters and take improvement seriously in europe is so insanely low for ultimate. Even the people that do play top tiers almost always do it because they played them before and now they happen to be better. Feels like a dead end.
"Had a offline session once this week and having the Bootcamp (with Meru, Gluto and Armada) so hopefully I'll feel better about ultimate. I'm seriously so over beating peoples secondary for hours while they flowchart the same options that work on worse people :("
"I've been really frustrated recently trying to get decent practice online with Ultimate. PT, specifically zard and squirtle, but even ivy, are just so bad and more importantly, so different online.  It doesn't help that 95% of top EU players don't seem to ever wanna improve =("

Good ultimate practice today! Finally feeling like I can say I'm good at ledge trapping and getting better at how to get up from the edge too. Still shit compared to 4 players and I need to learn more MU specific stuff but happy I'm making progress
Mainstage practice! Got several Ultimate players from stockholm over for some offline practice SUBTEMBER TODAY TOO

TSM LEFF PLAYS UNDEAD MAGE AND GANKS ALLIANCE NOOBS then melee practice :)
i legit had no idea who sharon tate was until after LMAO
once upon a time in hollywood... was an interesting watch. great acting and little plot to speak of but it worked well somehow despite its length.
ill never look up to someone like i looked up to vurtne and drakedog
Imagine if Melee disappeared because brawl came out like wow did to Cata
Gonna stream today maybe Classic wow and classic smash prob
I give up switchfest im gonna sleep GGs pacman
"I don't expect the average person who didn't play wow back in the day to ever really get how big classic wow is, but just imagine if your favorite, most influential thing of your childhood (be it your favorite band, game or sport) disappeared and was impossible to revisit."
"outside of melee, wow definitely helped me grow as a person more than any other game. Working with others and socializing with people with vastly different backgrounds is something wow did better than any regular game ever could"
"thinking back and remembering how much fear mongering there was around it, its pretty funny. people kept saying ""its so expensive"" and ""addictive"" and these days, spending $12 a month is nothing compared to lootboxes aimed at kids with 1% chance to get what you want."
"classic wow is such a cool thing. wow growing up was THE game of my generation, hell the THING of my generation. Almost everyone I knew played it and I spent countless hours just talking about it and met tons of people through it. It's been amazing finally getting to revisit that"
imported cider and wow classic queues
Going away over the weekend for non work reasons for the first time in a while! Already feeling stressed out and guilty but I'm gonna do my best to enjoy it and use the time off to recharge. I could use some time away from all the toxicity and harassment I've been receiving :(
Astral Chain 3 hours in impressions: A looot of cutscene and dialogue compared to your average Platinum game. Detective work is ok. Combat seems really promising. Story is a generic melting pot of other animes. Cliche as all hell. Overall interested to see where it goes!
"ASTRAL CHAIN FIRST PLAYTHRUUU got the game already, letsgo"
Positive Gamer plays Ultimate then wow &amp; melee
hOrde duh
Join razorgore EU if you want to join the guild &lt;years of research&gt;
INTERNET DIED BUT WE BACK classic wow with leff
wow classic undead mage
Back streaming! Playing some Ult and talking shine and shit and then Classic wow!
so happy to be home :)
Now I just gotta practice and refine the 3 styles of ledge trapping and make up for having like 4 years less of exp in it than everyone else and im gucci
I finally figured out what my ledgetrapping was missing If only there were good tutorials on this it wouldnt have taken me 9 months lmao
"If you're interested and top 50 in EU, write here/dm me on discord with the times you are most likely available during the day and what days work best.  Same goes for top EU ult players!"
"For melee I'm going to be setting up stream sessions daily with EU top players willing to netplay, and do reviews of the matchups after the fact through slippi. i'm also going to be spending a lot of time relearning how to ledgedash because of arduinos costing me several sets."
"My plan is essentially to design a way for me to improve a lot by consistently playing 1-2 hours online/analysis a day,  and focus the rest on Melee. And then  play Ult a lot when I can have people over for the day or for a bootcamp. Excited!"
"Thought a lot about what I could learn from Shine for Ultimate on my plane, and I feel like I know exactly what to work on. Next up is designing routines  to fix these holes in my game and I already got some good plans thought up. Bootcamp early september as well!"
excited to get home and keep improving. Step one is to take care of myself and focus on the people that matter :) and don't worry i'm not quitting ult or melee lmao
ill stream it if ppl want it :)
I want to play classic wow but I also want to do something with my life Decisions decisions
Melee &lt;3 Melee homies &lt;3
wow turns out people are a lot better than twitter/reddit jims
I knew u could do it @Samsora_ !congrats
What melee tournaments are left this fall? Outside of Mainstage and big house
Watching bowser lose to robin felt great
PLEASE?
Is there any way I can get a 4 port arduino with me home? I keep SDing because of them and I really want to be able to practice
"I don't want to play hard ball but I will if thats what it takes for it to make the scene better in general. Yesterday I was able to eat actual food once because I complained and had staff bring some in, but others like IBDW got nothing."
"I do think events in general expect more and more from top players, be it interviews, photos etc and rely more and more on them for the stream, yet they keep entry at 10 and don't consider them when making schedules, don't provide a way for them to eat during 13 hour days etc"
I hope next year is better. I'm still going to be far more selective about whats tournaments I enter but its important to remember that I wouldn't be where I am if not for TOs that do this shit for the love of the game/community. Its just really frustrating for me.
"Regardless of my own experiences at Shine I want to apologize to the TOs for using overly harsh language when complaining about Shine.  I still think its necessary to complain since its really seems to be the thing that leads to changes, but still. I know you guys mean well."
ye problem is 3rd or lower  at shine is less what most people would make just dropping out and streaming.
I know ur jealous fucks Stay irrelevant
Holy fuking shit so many jims in my mentions I keep blocking and they just keep making new accounts
I didn't drop out despite feeling like shit because I didn't wanna give anyone a bye in top 12 and I didn't start playing melee to care about some fucking rank. Still tho.
I wish we could somehow incentivize not dropping out. I thought about dropping out since its obvious I'm not gonna play my best and it would me losing to people I normally don't hurts rankings super hard lmao. So DQing when you feel off is definitely optimal rankings wise
Good practice for mainstage. Anyone whos opinion I care about know about my situation was so I couldn't care less what randoms think. Just gotta take this and learn!
"Lost another set to sds and tons of terrible plays, oh well. hope you guys enjoyed, tried to play for the community regardless of how bad I was feeling. Good luck Cody and ggs!"
Any puff players who can help me warmup??
Does anyone have handwarmers? Pls come to the left side of the stage. Extremely cold venue
Never done so many random ass fuckups in my life lmao Playing solid outside of that but man gotta hope these go away
man what fucking else is there to do in worcester
Congrats OG! Stockholm TI :O maybe ill finally be able to go to one
Do I watch TI or sleep HM
I just wish I could not be Leffen sometimes. Like just play and enter tournaments without being bothered every second. Win or lose I'd be happy.
Just gotta say fuck everyone and do myself for a bit. Maybe eventually I'll have time to do other shit but fuck man I need a break
"I take it way too personally when events and shit fucks me over because I keep trying to push the scene forward. I always have and its a major flaw performance wise. I just gotta accept that everything is going to be shit and make the best of it, not try to improve it."
"Trying to fix rulesets, schedules and shit like that really isn't worth it when it doesnt give anything back. My contribution to the scene is going to be only my gameplay and stream if I gotta play two games. I'm just stubborn I guess."
"I thought I could pull of a 13 hr day because I often play 12 hr at home to keep up with melee + ult + streaming in but thats exactly why I can't handle tournaments this bad. I need go to less events yes, but I need to stop streaming before shit events and stop trying to fix shit"
"Gotta stop burning myself out. I just start fucking hating everything, even if I win its not even fun at this point. going to try to relax with some actual food (fuck you venue) and sleep this shit off. If I feel better tomorrow I might play the rest of melee for practice."
"Played like 13 hours straight today, proud of myself for trying hard regardless of playing like shit in melee. I did the best I could with the situation. Now time to restttt"
"Don't get me wrong, mokys sick and has been putting in work, he def deserves winners top 8 way more. Just wish I couldve lost in a better fashion with less sds lmao"
Thats how it goesssss Ggs moky
Should I play in melee lmao Up next and no time to warmup lmao
Its even a command on my stream you can go in and checkit rn lmao
"If you respond ""ult is fine"" then I curse you to ten years of soundless 15 frame lag elitesmash for all enternity Also ur getting blocked 100% LMAO"
At least PT is fun :) only thing keeping me in it tbh. Squirtle esp
yeah if I only tried to find people playing those chars Definitely did not tweet and look for that constantly
I have time to play melee but I also wanna DQ cuz of how horrible this event has been
"Got my lowest placement while doing the best ive ever done in friendlies vs top players. Thats just Ultimate for you, knew my bracket was unlucky.  hopefully I get a better bracket, full of chars Ive played before next time ;)"
"Also the stream setup is straight TRASH I had to refuse to play before they would give me a headset, and it lagged like crazy"
Still not sure if Im playing btw
Made top 64 in melee too :0
Melee r2 pools... Pray for me
Any bowser or rosa or olimar players who can help me warmup?
hUH
Also because I'm playing Leon into Dabuz so me hating Ultimate after is like a 99% chance lmfao Fuck those characters fucking FUCK EM
Gonna tryyy to play my round 1/2 pool of melee just in case I lose early in Ult and I'm more salty at Ultimate than thirsty
Can a shine to msg me
My squirtle today is üí¶üí¶üí¶ but my charizard and ivy... RIP
"Made top 64 winners!! Beat 8bitman 3-2, lost two last hit games and almost choked last game as well after a full stock lead :( ggs!"
Playing 8bitman next Rob &gt;:((
OG has inspired me
Omw to venue pls no dq ( i have a bye but still)
I dont wanna get out of bed im too tired
"Does anyone at shine have a 2,5 to 3,5mm headphone cord? Lost mine and need it for tomorrow :("
Bro if I come in tomorrow to my 13 hour day and they don't even have sound on every god damn setup I am LOsING IT
"""why do people not approach me"" - character with the best frame data in the game but also more damage per move than bowser"
Peach is a fucking bitch dont let samsora fool you
SUP BITCHES
Still havent played on an ultimate setup with sound
"At this point I don't care if people think I'm a douche for not wanting to do fan interaction while practicing. I stream every day when I'm home and usually interact with the chat plenty then. If getting a signature,selfie or IRL time mid tournament is a dealbreaker then so be it"
"and yes since apparently this isnt obvious - no its not different if you ""only have a question about how to improve"""
Not going to do any signings or selfies this tournament outside of a meet n greet sunday (if I have time) Really tired and I'm seriously burnt out socially. Sorry to all the fans who wanted me for their pokedex :)
"""hey I know this is a bad time"" ...so why did you choose this time then???????"
"I'm so tired of tournaments. Always so fucking loud, people bothering you mid match every single second, no game sound and the only food in the venue is a food stand with hot dogs and nachos. Can't wait to go home."
Guess what... Many setups dont have sound...
Is there any bug spray in the vip room at shine? Pls?
"Not everyone needs to do content and be a top player, but if you don't like twitch, youtube or twitter? Well son you better be winning tournaments or start working on a side hustle"
"To be clear - this is not me saying ""dont do esports"" This is me saying: playing games for a living is something that a ton of people want to do. If you think you can just take it easy cuz you got it good now when everyone below you is working harder - ur wrong."
"It sucks, but if you spend your 18-30s with little to nothing saved up and you don't have a big brand and no real life work experience... Your life career wise is going to be in an extremely rough spot. So even if you are lucky enough to do esports full time rn - dont settle."
"Here's the real ass truth: esports, especially FGC is an all or nothing game.  Yeah you can pay rent with your temporary $1000 per month sponsor but that isn't something you can settle down with.  If you're not winning majors consistently or making great content yourr losing HARD"
Your results aren't going to change if you don't. Being bad against floaties is not a playstyle. Being impatient is not a playstyle.  People out here acting as if not knowing how to chaingrab is inherent to their zofiac sign or some shit.
This goes out to the melee players too: You have been a fringe top 30 player half your life and you think its just eventually going to change into winning majors when you arent willing to change your playstyle that you copied from someone else back in 2014?
Nerf joker tho
Like Fire emblem three houses came out a week before EVO started and I saw like 20 ultimate players talking about finishing their first playthrough before EVO and that shit is a 70 hour game The fuck u guys doing
"inb4 someone who never goes to tournaments saying ""but leffen you cant KNOW how hard they play maybe they play 8 hours in their hotel room every night!!"""
"I remember at Ultimate summit, the melee players would turn on ""First to 5"" in the rules to save time between matches, and ultimate top players who shall remain unnamed would turn it off because ""i dont like playing my main for more than 3 matches straight"" üò¨"
Rip EG üò≠
My eardrum feels like its about to burst after the flight :( tried all the basic remedies but the pain doesnt stop aaaa
How far is the hotel from the venue? Do u need to go outside?
uhHhhH do I just not go wtf
Hello america
Finding really good PT tech :O
DOTA
Dotw
getting better at using watergun! Pretty good move vs some chars Enjoy two zero to deaths
cling stall concept on yoshis/kalos  can also be done on PS2 to some degree obv joker can risk it and jump down and challenge but you can instantly come back with an aerial at basically all times and if airdodge before you cling you can spam R to tech without getting anything out
is there any hitbox visualizations for PT?
why cant i edit twitter vids anymore anyway my charizard is getting nasty
"Leaving for shine tonight! Last stream for a bit, come hang  positive vibes tonight :)"
Its a weird feeling because I'm not sure I enjoy tournaments for Ultimate much because of the melee overlap and new MUs in Bo3. Hopefully I'll get that one performance at one of the few tournaments I'll attend for Ult
I feel like I'm getting pretty scary in Ultimate in any matchup I know even decently. Not sure if I'll do well in any particular tournament tho but I feel like my peak is way higher than before.
will there be sound on setups for shine????
"okay nvm had the schedule wrong, i blame   still think that you shouldnt schedule a game to finish at 11pm and start 10am"
"and honestly they are not that hard to fix either! I stream 8 hours every single day and answer questions constantly, if you no one else can help then you can always just ask me in chat or on twitter."
Its really frustrating since top players are the only ones really affected by bad scheduling (since most people go out after R1 pools) and so it feels like we aren't even considered for the events. No top players would've okayed some of the schedule supermajors hosted recently.
"Not really, the reason top players complain so much is because the schedule isnt revealed until very late (or isnt even final two days before the event like for shine) and by then its ""too late"" to change. I really wish TOs could just ask the players the schedule affect the most."
after this event im fucking striking tho regardless fuck this shit
"feeling a lil better :o still unlikely to enter melee but if I somehow get to boston with little to no jetlag or I lose early in pools I'll consider it but please don't be dissappointed if I don't enter lmao, still 90% chance I DQ"
just really fucking sad and bummed out now. fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
"I'm sure someone will be like ""oh ya but thats because ur entering two games"" we have had two games or more since brawl, that is not an excuse to not have this figured out yet."
legit the only tournaments that have done this are summits and the mango LOL every other tournament this year has missed like 2-3 of these basic ass things
"All I want from a tournament is: - a Schedule that doesn't make you play 13 hrs straight and lets you get 8 hours of sleep. - sound on setups - a ""VIP"" room during bracket because sadly people do not respect personal space  - seeding - Bo5 in top 64  so see ya at summits only..."
"I seriously wish I could just not go but I already booked my flight so I'm going for Ult only. Like I might lose in pools but I'd rather do that then play that schedule. Sorry to my fans, I'll go to another event to make up for it.  Let the record show that its on them not me."
like even if they change it at this point i'm already fucking done. I seriously should not have to do their scheduling for them. its fucking obvious you should not have players play until 11pm and then start at 10am.
"TOs cant fucking have the schedule ready 2 days before its fucking ridiculous Tells me ""11pm for melee is the a late estimation"" and yet Shine runs late every year. Sorry I don't have much faith in the TOs that realized UCF was off and then decided to ""wait until its over"""
"Melee top 48-top12 runs to 11PM on saturday night Melee top 12 starts either 10 am 11am or 12am depending on who you ask Ult ends at 9PM and starts at 5PM (again, probably not set in stone either)  I sub goaled Ultimate and it has a schedule thats not fucking toxic so yeah im out"
whYyYyY do you not have the schedule public and figured out TWO DAYS before the event
lmao i hate tournaments  you guys better be serving me oysters and lobster in the vip room or im pulling a zero any tournament now
"like with schedules that has me playing from 10AM -11PM (pools every hour, zero breaks) and then 10AM - 9PM  i seriously can not do both games if that's how its gonna be. hope theres some major fuckup in the online schedule and that its not actually not that bad..."
AND THEN IF I MAKE TOP 12 THEN I HAVE TO GET UP AT 10 AM AND PLAY BOTH GAMES AT THE SAME TIME ROFLFIHASOPIDHASOPIDHIOPASH
why does my shine schedule have me playing from 10am to 11PM jesus fuck
Can someone explain my shine schedule? Do I play ult and melee at the same time?? (Im in H and J pools)
"I did a video with TSM describing 5 tips on how to get good in Smash (and any other game!) I think this one turned out great, hit a RT if you want more of this content :)"
yo im godlike
"Guys just shield vs hero, what can go wrong? flame slash is frame 6 and this was with only psych up, full shield"
"Live with Offline Practice for Shine! Got some people over, lets get good"
also this is the command he got the fucking code from...
I SPECIFICALLY WARNED HIM and said anyone would get permad lmao
This fucking shitter is leaving out that I said 3 times that only EU and Ethernet can join the lobby because I'm trying to practice for Shine.  Nice lie you piece of trash.
streaming ult !grind again! melee later almost at the sub goal to play Ult at shine!
this one is sick enough to deserve its own thread sound on!
weeb shit
here are some Ultimate clips with funny music timing  Sound ON
somedays u play good other times you learn
played like shit today but thats okay
anyway im streaming ultimate then melee practice
"Honestly the reason why I think the ""wait and see"" mentality is so big on twitter/reddit is because the average person doesn't actually play smash in tournaments or even seriously at all, much less understand top level smash. So reacting to the results is the only thing they know"
"The only thing waiting will do is make the argument about whether or not we are just knee jerk reacting to Dabuz/Salem/Puppeh etc beating Leo with Hero, and people that have never gone to a tournament saying that he couldve shielded that Thwack."
"We already know the frame data. We already know the % chances. Anyone with a brain can tell that you can not avoid most of the RNG by ""proper play"". Even if you are in the ""just shield/jump/react/read the future"", even then you can't stop Zoom or inbetween stock Buffs."
Waiting for people to do well at majors with Hero is another argument I really dislike. The ban is not about how good he is and obviously Hero is good enough to win majors when Piranha Plant can. At that point you are outright punishing the Hero players for doing well.
"The weak thing to me is realizing that Hero's design is not designed for competitive play, yet still thinking that we CANT BAN HIM because Sakurai made him.  Sakurai and Nintendo has time and time again shown that they don't care for, or even outright dislike competitive smash."
"My new #1 hated thing about Hero apologists is calling people ""weak"" or ""scared"" competitors because we won't ""just adapt"" to Hero. Like yeah we are all so WEAK for not playing with items on, what are you scared of assist trophies??? Omegalulzers!!"
Thanks for all the support recently and I promise I'll shut up about hero... Eventually... Once hes banned... :)
Honestly been really happy and proud over myself recently.  Been taking better care of myself health wise and still doing great work wise while also dealing with new apartment + visa. I know you guys think I'm angry all the time but ranting on twitter is my only vice LMAO
getting dummy good in the ultimate matchup I know damn I got so much new PT tech and learned so much from smashcon. if i don't get bored of the game i'll def eventually win shit but thats a big if LMAO
!Shine Practice - hero apologists do not enter. Ultimate practice first then Melee i repeat if you think hero is fine go somewhere else
"""magic burst is just as broken as ness downsmash"" jesus fucking christ"
((for real tho im just messing with ya id be down to talk with dabuz fuck salem)
(see that I used top 32 because dabuz and salem got 49th at smashcon)
if hes still not banned after shine and theres any player who places top 32 at majors that wants to discuss it with me (if your in favor of not banning) please let me know. I'll host a debate/podcast or something.
honestly i used to not care about hero getting banned or not that much since PT beats him and most ult chars suck to fight anyway  but now I really want him to be banned because of how absolutely terribly the people who defend him do so. I can't believe the shit im reading.
"""bro just dont get hit"""
time for a HERO SPELL TIER LIST also talking about which ones that beat shield/jump etc
like imagine making condescending tweets like this without ever actually labbing the character or the options
live talking about some hero shit and playing him and then melee/fireemblem!
Yet you see people get hit by that. Same thing with incineroar/ganon/ridley side B. And they dont have options that kill you at 0 for not shielding.
"Also anyone who thinks theyll never get hit by hatchet man is an idiot. Its slow but trust me people get hit by far more reactable shit all the time when there's not 20+ options like with hero. Bowser down B for example is 34fpoint blank, and usually 40ish before actually hittinf"
Let me spell it out for you: SHIELDING DOES NOT BEAT HEROS MENU. he can cancel it to dash grab (frame 13 option) and anything else and most of his moves are safe on shield in practice. Shielding does NOT avoid dying to thwack or magicburst with any kind of certainty.
"Not to mention ledgetraps, in between stocks and recovery situations where the opponent often has no counterplay at all. Its reallt infuriating trying to argue with people who can't understand basic theory crafting :("
"Honestly the fact that prominent players in the Ult community think you can react to Hero's menu option blows my mind. Even low level standard fighting game players understand that its not about the startup of the move, its the frame they differ from eachother that matters."
I don't think I've seen a single argument arguing against banning Hero that can't be used to allow items or hazards stages. You guys got anything?
"this type of shit is exactly what i hate about the smash scene. blatant NA bias and fuck everyone else mentality, regardless of the facts. the fact that this was liked 234 times as of writing is fucking disgusting."
lets talk about the Hero Ban and other shit
"It also infuriates me when people use faulty logic such as ""you can play around RNG"" or ""hes not the best char so hes okay"" or ""if we ban hero we have to ban other RNG chars"" but thats just me being anal about fighting game conversations in general, not because of Hero really."
"I do like arguing about Hero because I think its interesting and again, I am for banning him - but I care WAY less about this than say, bo5 or LGL - I would never not go to a tournament because Hero theres like a 1 in 75 chance I meet a hero each match."
"alright lets to be clear: I'm for a hero ban but I personally don't care much personally because Ult is not that important for me competitively, and because few TOP players will pick him most likely. I'm strongly for people running tournaments with their own rulesets though."
Brb
Ultimate player says edgeguarding is easy. Tune in for the heated live stream where I tear this guy apart sometime in the future ;))
It blows my mind that even top players miss this shit. Reminds me of the great dragonrush debate of dbfz lmao
YOU CANT CANCEL SMASHES WITH JUMP OR 4 FRAMES INTO LITERALLY ANYTHING Why do people act as if a 6 frame half screen normal is reactable because it has a windup that can be used into 4 different spells and any other move with only 4 frames extra. Its basic theory crafting PLS
Playing more Ult now
The crits + down b rng + hocus pocus + language barrier = pls ban.
Good on South Australia for banning Hero. I wish more would follow suit although I doubt it. Id rather play with items and final smashes than vs Hero. Hes clearly not design for competitive play and anyone decent at smash should be able to see that regardless of your ban opinion
Live with Offline Ultimate practice! Talking about what I learned from Smashcon and  subgoaling/practicing for Shine!
This game does not have characters that are deep or hard to master. Face that and stop patting yourself on the back when you aint winning shit.
"Pokemon Trainer Tier List:  SS: Tweek A++: Leffen A: Puppeh, Pandarian, Hikaru B: Wishes Woke: Taking pride in being ""5th best X main"" like these lists do is fucking pathetic when Tweek, Leo etc literally picks your character and is the best X main by the second friendly. SMH."
again i have made 0 dollaridos from Ult tournaments and no the subs u get after a good performance does not even close to make up for the loss overall in stream rev Ty for understanding :)
incase u missed the stream I'm subgoaling entering Ult at Shine Will still enter it at future events and maybe go for Ult summit but at important melee events I feel like subgoaling is the only real way to justify the hit my melee performance/health takes!
Back! Watching Smashcon Highlights and talking shit
SALEMSLAYER69 celebrates Smashcon Victory playing Ult and rewatching smashcon stuff!
retweet if you can hear this image
super chill jetlag stream?
Bro half the coolness of a character comes from their walking animation

Couldn't find someone I liked much in Soul Calibur either
no cool characters in smash 64 or 4 imo

"Honestly dont care much,just snnoying that im so forgetful sometimes LMAO"
Remembering everything when youre newly woken up is actually impossible
...i forgot my trophy on the flight and went to costumer service and they didnt find something LOL im an idiot Might have to have it sent to me if they eventually find it.
The grind doesn't stop. Landed in London now :)
Security wont mind ... Right?
How the fuck do I get my trophy home without breaking it this thing is so fucking tall
Quick SALEM SLAYER CELEBRATION also I won melee stream come hang in my hotel
"I just realized, I was playing Octopath last year during my evo trip too :O only two games I've played on my own lmao"
Shoutouts to Fire emblem three houses for keeping me sane during friday.  Couldn't get out of bed all day and it was the only thing that could distract me from feeling guilty about not practicing. Games ugly as sin but with a pretty fun gameplay loop tho and story is picking up.
"Imagine if Fox got nerfed after I won 3 majors in a row in 2015, or peach when Armada had his streak, or Hbox last year. There can't be any storylines if everyone just calls for nerfs instantly."
Leo is easily the best. It will be truly sad if Joker gets nerfed and the others never get to beat this version of him. Good shit.
HEY WHERE WAS MY FUCKIN CONFERTI
yo this korean bbq has a netplay code? Slippi or 5.9?
Its TIME
6-0d hbox and beat Salem what more can you ask for
Super proud of myself for pulling through despite a month long break from melee. Not the hardest bracket but  I don't think anyone couldve stopped me today tbh. Time for some foooood and then cheer on Tweek!
I haven't eaten all day send help
Send food
I am the fucking best
Broke the 3rd place curse POG
Winner finals!! Playing solid but gotta step it up another level to take this
"Tired af, slept well but mid day jetlag shit hitting me. Gonna try to power up and push through witv adrenaline"
damn maister made top 8? Sick losers run
Any peach mains who can help this poor fox player
i am not going to do this btw  But in return Just please can you get sound on the setups for me
"i need to start requesting royalties from events to enter ultimate, i have made zero dollarinos in prize money and my matches have made people so much LMAO at least I got the twitch subs (that I lose like 500 of to go to events üòÖ)"
"Feels like every ult major I go in with a shitty seed, upset a few players, lose to Mkleo or tweek + 1MU i didnt know lmao. Sadly can't really expect much better until I get better practice, hope I at least brought you guys some entertaining sets!"
"Yikes, I am so bad at that MU with PT!  He played really solid as well and I couldn't learn the MU in time. GGs everyone, now I can finally focus on Melee :D"
Playing someone named Blazing Pasta in losers LOL im scared
"Aw man, had that last game! Tweeks sick tho, def way better than me, esp in that matchup. Felt like I was slowly figuring things out but not fast enough."
Up vs Tweek next üòÖ
Also when the f does bo5 start???
Who needs MU exp when you have ultimate gamer genes
Is there any game and watch at the venue rn? hElp
thank you guys for the game and watch tips! Really helped me justify staying in bed
MU tips appreciated as well
Any game and watch main who can help me warmup Literally 0 exp in this MU lmao
go* fuck this game and its characters sometimes LMAO
i don't wanna get out of bed just to lose to a game and watch up Bing 55 times out of shield and killing me at 0 with 9 but here we to I GUESS
This area has great food tbh
"Headed back now, super fucking tired. Gotta play Ultimate at 10  am tomorrow, two games + jetlag is too much man, it's fun but definitely not going to do this often :(   Hopefully I lose early in Ult so I can win melee ooor win both events thats cool too"
Melee top 8 winners ultimate top whatever winners by beating Salem. Fundamentals pulled me through today!
Any good sheiks who can help me warmup? In vip area
I almost threw that LOL GGs :))
"People are hyping this up like crazy lmao. I personally don't care much, we have no in game beef. Regardless of the result I hope people aren't toxic to either player. Trash talk is fine but don't let it go overboard :)"
"Beat Seth (yoshi) 2-1! Lost game one pretty hard then won 1stock low% then 2 stock mid%! Playing new MUs is scary af in this game, next up is salem with Hero LOL"
When I have to play ult pls someone come get me in VIP area
maybe run bo5 in top 64 at super majors???
"Regardless of your opinion on wobbling, wanting it banned cuz Axe lost in a bo3 in a matchup hes known to be weak in is stupid and reactionary af.I I personally wouldn't mind either way but yeah"
"Bleh weird mu and not playing too hot, oh well I clutched it! Melee now, lets hope ult hasnt ruined me"
Up on some stream next for my ult pool WF
Why is it 2019 and theres no fucking sound on any setup lol
No sound at setups + less delay = disaster inc
I am currently garbage at offline ult lmfao
"Top 32 in winners in melee, ultimate pools next! Stomach issues :("
When does bo5 start for melee? Not until top 32???
Any falco main who can help me warmup? Setup 313 atm
"Hope you all understand! I know there's people who traveled far to meet me but I can't help it, going to try sunday if I don't make it to top 8."
Going to stay off social media and not going to do signings/selfies tomorrow since I need all the energy I got to make it as far as possible in both games.
Really felt like I needed to get good practice today (derust in melee + get used to offline Ult) but trying to not guilt trip myself over resting when i needed it. Its hard though :( But I just gotta trust in my ability and try my best tomorrow. I believe.
tried getting out of bed all day but im just gonna give up. Jetlag you win today. Gonna try again tomorrow
"Jetlag sucks Gotta start traveling earlier, tried to with this one but late visa etc Feeling so tired, cant even get out of bed -_-"
"Done with melee pools, going back to the hotel to take a nap to try to deal with the jet lag :x"
Uhhh am I gonna get dqd cuz of the line Got 10am pools
"Like yeah it seems good now, but imagine if in smash 6 the buffer is toggleable and they do basic quality of life things such as improve the online, not make you repick your characters after every match and delete Hero from the roster."
"""man how can we complain about buffer in ult when smash 4 bayo exists"" Bro what if theres a game without neither"
ok how many people think the ex smash 4 players will be saying the same things about ultimate in a couple years
SO TIRED
"Didn't have to go through secondary questioning because of my new visa :O Got through customs in 15 minutes holy shit im so relieved. In Washington now, big thanks to @TSM and everyone who wrote helped write recommendation letters, super happy to have it all done! :)"
"Oh ya probably no streams until Tuesday :( sorry, and I appreciate everyone who stays subbed :)"
In melee my play is in a really weird and fun place. Got a lot of inspiration and new ideas I'm excited to test and its been working either great or awful so far lmao.  I know I can push the limits of this game further.
Not confident that I'll be able to play my absolute best in both games for now but I think I can learn to manage it with time.  Its gonna be a tough weekend but I'm gonna do my best and see where I'm at and then go from there.
"smashcon will be a great start to the second half of the year.  Finally got everything sorted out now (apartment, visa etc) so all thats left to do is beat people in video games. Going to use smashcon to test if I can play both ult and melee, hopefully it works out!"
i am on my way to smashcon
PLEASE?
people who compare heros rng to gnw and peach make me so tired who the fuck said anyone liked stitches and 9s
will setups at smashcon have audio? and will they have headphone jack splitters? also is there a vip room
these two are such sad bangers
my favorite music type right now is upbeat and high BPM songs about sad things or with a melancholic undertone  link me more pls
did zeros video seriously bring up hocus pocus as the main reason people dislike hero lol
bitches i am not going to spoonfeed you how to use movement and play footsies if it was easy everyone would do it
"Defensive movement in this game is incredibly strong since shields are not good against aerials, and moving around in neutral and only going forward once youre confident in your option, makes you significantly harder to predict and cheese."
When I look at top level ultimate theres a two big things that really set the top 5 or so apart from the others and its 2 things tbh: 1. Not dying early avoiding and playing around your opponents easy cheese regardless if you take damage for it. 2. Using the movement Ult gave you
"Also hero is fucking toxic and he has no place in a competitive setting. And hes pretty damn good.  No RNG hero is midish, ok rng is high, good rng is top tier and great rng is SSS+++ tier."
"This might make them a worse tournament character since its common to be playing off with one pkmn, but it will also require the opponent to actually know how to fight zard. Some matchups that were hard are easier and some that were easy before are now even. Hmmm"
"After 7 hours of offline Hero/New PT my impressions are: PT is better but even harder to play, you cant get away with knowing only the ivy matchup vs each char, you now need to know every matchup with all 3 pokemon. Using razor leaf dair and Up B well is significantly harder too."
why
whats the ult stagelist for smashcon
Streaming Smashcon Ult practice now! Got some top players from Stockholm over to try out the new patch offline
Got my visa :O time to see if theres any flights for smashcon left :o
"chillin with some fire emblem  Hard, Classic, timeskip soon? + evo talk"
after rewatching some sets from EVO Sunday ive realized that Sekiros camerawork is actually not that bad
Doing analysis of EVO top 8! Starting with Protobanham vs Light!
Live! Talking EVO and analysing it! then melee practice for smashcon :)
90% of non arsene kills to clarify
Also I know Leo is godlike at landing fair 1 but still. He got 90% of his kills with an unsafe move on shield and I don't even remember people punishing it once.
"I know, theres a fuckton of characters so its hard to know every MU. The point is that Leo doesn't display even close to as such obvious flaws in MU knowledge as those who face him."
The amount of times Leo got 50% or a kill because the opponent didn't wait on the angel platform was ridiculous. Its the most basic thing to change yet it was seen like 5 times. Don't get me started on how predictably people recovered vs him or how many reactable side bs hit.
I sincerely hope Joker doesn't get nerfed just because Leo is better than everyone else. Not only is joker an entertaining character to watch but he is also exposing the ultimate players inability to adopt even basic countermeasures to the char who consistently wins the majors.
":( GZ to Leo tho, incredible stuff but  ;("
WHAT A SET

Wooo
Hooooly
HUh
lets go shanks!
So hype for Go1 vs sonicfox!!
at least the players that make top 8 get paid lots!
"evo really plays 5 sponsored ad trailers, then plays a wholeass set from last year, then goes to a empty ""be right back screen"" every half hour while theres 50 upsets happening offstream huh"
I feel bad for all the dbfz players who didn't get good sleep because of the schedule and things running late üò¨ I wish this stopped being so common :(
"Gl everyone today!  I'll be watching all day, hope to see some great matches."
"thanks for watching the stream! Honestly I really wish EVO stepped up their Day 1 game, today was extremely lackluster as a viewer. The jumpoff is good in theory but execution was lacking imo. At least tomorrow we will have tons of good matches so lets watch em together :)"
((OBVIOUSLY THROWING CRABS IS NOT OKAY))
man I can't believe I'm writing this but I miss when Smash Drama was about people throwing crabs send tweet
first fighting game with a decent netcode? POG
"and legit been working so many hours on the visa since early spring, will have more time and energy to actually stream AND practice, not just do 1"
"Oh yeah, update about the visa. Called the embassy and figured things out, should have it by early next week so I'm basically confirmed for Smashcon.  Feeling happy and releived, been struggling to stay motivated when I was scared to not be able to attend anything :)"
Ok but watch me actually practice melee from now on tho
stream myself watching evo?
i will stream at some point tho
well since i aint doing shit this weekend im just gonna go get off twitter and sit on my couch and play fire emblem :v
Clarification about me missing EVO  Read:
"Called support and they say they cant do anything, gotta call the embassy which is already closed for today. GG no Evo for me :("
"My passport with my visa arrived, just in time so I could make it to EVO. But I couldn't pick it up because, well, you need ID to verify and the only one I have atm that they recognize is my passport... showed cards &amp;bank statements from 5 years back and had jennie vouch, but no."
items and final smashes are deadass way less RNG then Hero
"Live! Going to focus on playing Charizard today, and of course a little more RNG Hero play! waiting for my passport to see if I can go to evo as well :o"
New charizard is actually a character
more hero/charizard practice! come in and lets roll the dice
I never have to care about seeding again. I will embrace the randomness and crit Leo out of smashcon in pools
Can't wait to rob people with Hero as they say RNG is not that bad Can't wait LOL
"He is fun to play as, but incredibly awful to play vs lmao. Great stream char too"
Its probably a good thing for me tho so I'm not sad. Now it'll be easier for me to just accept ultimate for what it is and focus on something else to get my competitive need satisfied tbh.
"Hero isn't going to be banned but I personally wish he was. Top tier or not, I would much prefer to ban any char with this much BS and RNG just like I don't like OTKs in card games etc. Not overpowered just incredibly degenerate. That said I'm a hero main now fuck everything LMAO"
Does anyone have the hitbox differences for charizard nair?
live with more hero/charizard buff gameplay trying out more broken shit
the more I play hero offline the more I think hes top tier af with some hard matchups
Live with Offline 4.0 Practice! Let's see how stupid Hero is and try out new PT buffs/nerfs!
"Also fuck out of here with these ""hero might not be top tier so the fact that his moves randomly kill you at 0 is not stupid"""
"That said I really wish he wasn't legal for smashcon. People will not have time to find good hero practice/counterplay and if he has any game breaking bugs/exploits... Rip. Oh well, maybe this is all a sign for me lmao"
I don't think hero is top tier overall but he is A LOT stronger vs characters that can't rush him down. Many of his down B moves are insanely stupid and strong so the more he gets to pull for free in any MU the better and more RNG based he becomes
"Honestly hero is a fun casual character but I already know I will hate playing against him. I hope PT feels better tomorrow, going to try them offline. Initial thoughts is about 2-5 spots worse on the tier list but with a slightly more even matchup spread. rip vinewhip."
hero is so fucking stupid
"inb4: ""uh ivy dair was braindead""  ya maybe against little mac or ur shitty elite smash ganon"
"PT overall is definitely worse IMO, you play Ivy significantly more than you play Charizard. But this does make matchups where Ivy struggled significantly better since charizard exists now. I'm really going to miss Up B confirms and Ivy dair tho, the hardest to master moves tbh"
"why is ivysaur the only character to get actual nerfs not fixes rofl why does charizard fair still not work rest of the char buffs are nice tho, don't like way worse edgeguarding by ivy but oh well."
new patch / HERO IS LIVE DOWNLOADING NOW
EVO 2021 Leffen vs Armada grand finals
"Hero out in 2-3 hours! Live with the waiting room going to go over trailers, thoughts on nerfs/buffs and maybe play some melee while we wait"
literally what
to be clear I'm not saying hero is going to be the best and broken thats why he is a badly designed character. I just don't think that much RNG is fun or healthy for any competitive scene. Obviously we shouldn't ban him before he gets released tho lmao
new merch dropping soon  made by @NickuVee
Heal costs 7 MP It recovers 11%  110% heal for 70 MP you get back around 1 MP per second AND you get it back every hit  hope youre ready for hero mains to camp you
its time to stand up for whats right ban hero today
okay sakurai we get it you didnt like when we whined about every sword character had a down b counter we are sorry please go back
Hero from Dragon Quest Eleven S releasing September 27th is the worst designed fighting game character i have ever seen
HERO COMING SOON AHHH
LIVE! HERO DIRECT SOON (30 min) Talking wishes and predictions for the patch until then!
I hope people IRL stream ult brackets and other games at EVO 3k entrants with one stream is going to be wild
HERO TOMORROW MELEE TODAY! Live playing with @zaik_ssbm
"(again, its okay to want the game to be different, but wanting to make a character just straight up worse cuz they win is awful in general)"
Honestly I'm just tired of patch culture. Both the whining and the downplaying aspects.
"Just to be clear: lots of chars in ultimate have BS, and a char can be top tier and stupid even if someone maining them hasnt won a major. and just cuz they win doesnt mean theyre stupid either. I don't want zss to be nerfed, just changed. Same goes for basically any top tier atm"
im sure the fastest character movement wise with the best defense and top tier offense with a frame 4 OOS kill move and god tier aerials and the best move in the game is not good because she doesn't play like she did in 4 and oh also she needs to learn to time her sh nair
in ultimate getting out of disadvantage is legitimately a solid third of the game and she just skips it because fuck fundamentals. Even when you see pros hard read it they rarely hit down B and even then rarely with a hard punish. B r a i n d e a d
now that zss won is it now acceptable to whine about her?  that down b is probably the best move in the game.  Completely fucked up design wise. Having a get of jail free card from any form type of disadvantage and that grounds you into kill at 70? And spikes from a safe aerial?
"Done with embassy appointment, waiting to get my passport sent back to me now! Sadly not looking like I'll make EVO at this rate but it's possible and I'll most likely make smashcon! Annoying but I'm used to this at this point lmao"
"Dream patch: drops hero, fixes online, deletes about 25 degenerate characters üôè"
Both excited and scared of Hero dropping. I hope the character is cool but I feel like some nerfs to top tiers are coming and I don't think any character deserves nerfs rather than fixing stupid moves atm.
"At the American embassy today to finalize the visa stuff. Going to be several hours of waiting, all with no music/phone. Hopefully I make it through *_*"
that jojo ep was something
Lost my phone yday and the person who returned it made it impossible for me to thank/tip her. Thank you whoever you are ü•∫
im LIT
In general I just wish people that claim ultimate is so perfect and that its a crime to complain about it would spend some time actually highlighting the good points instead of being personally offended because I want my multi hits moves to connect.
That doesn't mean I want ultimate to be a 1:1 copy of Melee.  I've played many fighting games and all of them have good parts and bad parts. The thing that pisses me off is that many ultimate players act like you are insulting them personally for wanting good netcode
"But yeah, I'd be lying if I said that theres a smash game thats a better competitive game than melee. It just executes the formula far better overall despite having some flaws still. There's a reason all the smash clones base of melee rather than brawl/smash 4."
"You can in fact dislike parts for smash ultimate, like rage, degenerate characters and execution systems (buffer) without ""wanting it to be melee"". You can even want core mechanics such as DI and Edgeguarding to work properly without wanting it to be a melee clone! Crazy, right?"
"so  TLDR:  Going to focus on Melee, then streaming, then Ultimate. I will try to play mostly offline ult and invite/bootcamp with top players + analysis. I will still enter tournaments but I will continue to DQ out if I feel like the schedule fucks melee up for me. Ty for reading"
"I feel like I've been playing kinda rusty or just barely not rusty in Melee ever since my visa got pulled in 2015, and then DBFZ in 2018 and now Ult in 2019. I feel like I've been doing good because my fundamentals and mentality have carried me, but I can be much better still"
"I know I could be the best in Ultimate if I sacrificed enough for it, but I honestly don't think I'd really get that much out of becoming #1 to make it worth it. I feel like there's honestly a lot of people who just play ultimate because they are already good at it just like me."
"and I know people are going to say ""well uh people dont grind because the flat earth is tilted fifteen degrees north today and also people play in hotel rooms"" but the real ones fucking know what i'm talking about."
"I also know that I wouldn't quit Melee for any of these, yet I have still put more time into Ultimate, where I have the constant feeling that my grind/get good mentality isn't really common in the community, and hell isn't even rewarded much by the game. I'm an idiot honestly."
"I asked myself honestly, if a bad patch happened tomorrow with Hero that further nerfed kill moves and didn't fix online/all the other stupid shit, would I quit ultimate? Will I quit ultimate if Granblue versus is good? honestly yeah probably."
"My ideal format for ultimate would honestly be a league type format where you could have time to prepare for people and longer sets would allow sets to progress past ""can i beat your flowchart"" I know this isn't going to happen though so I just have to adapt."
"had this thought a couple days ago but i thought i should write it online: I enjoy ultimate and improving on it, but for me entering tournaments is not fun because of how many matchups there are and patches. For someone living in Europe + playing melee those are big."
Let's continue Waifu Emblem: Three Houses! we are EDELGANG here
(unlike ultimate...)
"Fire emblem was definitely better than the trailers made it seem but I'm still early game so I'm not sure how good it is yet. Definitely going to play more today tho, really fun and chill stream game!"
NEVERMIND ITS SUNDAY =(
its today
Back with more Fire emblem!
"starting now, download finished!"
Going to be starting Fire Emblem Three Houses now! Game has actually gotten really good reviews... but what will the leff review be? Subs will vote on what house to choose!
Playing Ultimate with @ArmadaUGS ! then melee grinddd
"the only good thing about new twitter is that whenever you get a shitty ass question, you can just hover over the account and it'll say  ""Not followed by anyone you're following""  like damn twitter i know hes wrong but damn"
"I really feel like people forget just how incredibly rough up and coming players from smaller regions have it to ""make it"" in smash. I'm lucky since I got TSM through melee but most never get the chance to travel enough to develop their talent."
"For many players, especially those who don't live in good regions/the us, the PGR and such are really important for them to use to get a sponsor.  I knew going into it that the pgr was going to be shitty but I wish it at least manage to highlight a few foreign players better."
"as someone who personally doesnt give a fuck about where people rank me (i know people dont believe me but i 100% dgaf about my own rank), I do think its sad that the rankings for ultimate are so insanely biased in Americas favor consider how global of a game it is. Really sucks."
parrying with squirtle is the wave
"good practice today, offline ultimate is definitely a different game =) =("
"LIVE! Evo practicing today, got stockholms best over. FT. M, Biscuit &amp; Pepito!"
"went to the dentist for the first time in a long time, was a lil scared üò¨ but everything was good :D"
"planned on streaming more melee practice but im gonna have to cancel, my food has got me snoozy so ill practice some off stream instead ^_^ tmrw I got a bunch of people coming over for ult but ill stream melee mid day EU time!"
Now we wait for it to cool
Ya boi is making frittataaaa #Cheffen
Finally analyzing Tweeks PT from LTC7 /why i was WRONG OMEGALULZERS
streaming live! Going to practice a little Ult then do the Tweek @ LTC7 analysis! Then melee all night
People would sometimes run with a win/leave cuz they lost hard in other games sometimes (but not with 100% consistency like ult) but at least those games actually had a proper ranking system.  the fuck you saving that gsp for
It's insane how lazy and scrubby the community online is for ultimate. Never had to experience anything close to it before in all of my fighting game experience.
"Theres 3 paths for Ultimate practice Online in EU: 1. wait 10 minutes for a shitty elite smash player, who leaves because he lost too hard or leaves after winning 1 game 2. join arena, get kicked 3. ask top players to play, wait 3 hours, spend 2 hours beating their secondaries"
Updated my patreon with cool new tiers!!  Check it out and support my road towards becoming the best!!!!
its time which half of the cast would I delete and WHY
streaming some Ult and then some meleeeeee and then some late night mario makerrrr long stream
I love my new place a little bit too much. I never wanna leave
i (probably) didnt make pgr I have a plan for this too I will
if i make pgr.....  I will do absolutely nothing
Played some melee today and oh man this game is so insanely good and fun. I swear playing ult just makes me realize how lucky I am to have melee as my job.  And I still have fun playing ult too lmao
bowser is stupid good lmao
Been grinding Joker and watching VSFighting all day here with my new Leffen @LogitechG headset :) Comfiest headset yet!
"I deleted my last tweet. I still stand by what I say but I'm so fucking tired of blocking people. I hate that ""dont be rascist"" is a controversial statement in 2019."
Yo that finishhh Good stuff Wawa
I get that some people think my view is depressing but i dont think so. I don't think every athlete needs to enjoy going to the gym or doing repetitive drills to like the art of learning and pushing themselves. If it was easy then everyone would be able to do it.
"That all said I think I'm going to try to focus on playing more Melee on stream since I think it's more entertaining to watch me be happy lol Ult practice will still happen on stream, going to invite top players to the lounge as well, but more melee is needed for sure!"
I need to be able to perform to the best of my ability anyway. I should focus on that part instead.
"I wish I could just enjoy ultimate for what it is, but if I look at it too much its too hard for me not to focus on the games flaws and what I'd wanna fix. But as a competitor I need to kill that urge. Not everything needs to be enjoyable. Not every matchup or game is fair."
I get that this sounds incredibly whiny/salty but I'm honestly happy I understand myself better now. I don't have to enjoy a game or think its good to enjoy improving myself in that game. I finally understand why people who dislike SFV or smash 4/ult keep playing it.
In Ultimate I feel like I'd do better in every matchup if I just treated them like they were melee puff.  The only real parts I enjoy from Ult thinking back to it is playing PT and improving. Nothing else is really entertaining long term and thats fine :)
"This is a realization I had with Puff in Melee and I started doing way better vs Puff soon after. Accept that the game is not a game I find good competitively, and focus on finding the enjoyment of winning at any cost no matter how degenerate. Fun is just a happy surprise!"
I feel like todays session of ultimate was incredibly miserable but very productive. I'm finally realizing that expecting matchups to be fun to play or the game to reward fundamentals is just plain stupid. I need to focus on cheesing and making my opponent bored and frustrated.
Live! Going to grind some netplay vs Top EU players in both Ult and melee today! Starting with Ult
"I parry and I parry and yet the punish never comes. I hit them and I hit them and yet somehow they still return onstage. It's never ending. I can hear them say ""but Inkling can't kill"" as they fair me at 40 offstage to my death.  Help. Someone. Please. Don't let Leo pick them."
I get half my damage from the Inklings just being drunk with power and double jumping with fair back on stage so much even Duck would shake his head and blink violently. Mentioning how much damage that jab just did is now considered a Slur in sweden.
"I see rollers shield poking and clanking with moves only to hit me after when I close my eyes. I still don't have the faintest idea of how splat bomb works or how to deal with it consistently. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, randomness is just a part of life I guess."
Played like 20 hours vs inkling in the last 4 days. This is my story: Despite my greatest effort I haven't been able to edgeguard them once and I'm 89% confident their hurtbox does not exist. I've long since had to accept that melee marths dash dance is fair now.
Getting real tired of not being able to use fundamentals much in Ult lmao Need a lil break Melee grind tonight
hmu if u have higher res versions
the non-cgi parts of the new eva trailer looks dope  #NewProfilePic
still grinding offline ultttt now for EVO :o
Visa extension got approved! Confirmed for EVO!
Offline Ultimate practice for EVO! got a couple peeps over in the leff lounge ready to play
"Getting so much better in Ultimate man, and I love PT more than ever. buuut playing against some of the characters in this game is worse than working retail during black friday so idk what I wanna do with it."
practicing vs EU top ult players! playing vs Space (Inkling) Right now
"I think complaining and wanting nerfs can be fine, hell I wanted olimar and other degen chars nuked, but when you combine constant whining about whoever won the latest tournament with almost no players actually grinding the game seriously it just becomes ridiculous."
"The funniest part about Leo winning with Joker is seeing how much he exposes the others bad recovery habits + lack of their own offstage edgeguarding.  Sure is crazy that you die earlier when hit offstage, better nerf so there's even less things to be good at :))))"
And can we nerf kill power guys??? That makes for the most interesting game!!
I guess we gotta buff recoveries and nerf joker's edgeguarding so even 1 year olds can recover consistently outside of RNG 2 framing.
its crazy to me that someone can watch this and think the problem is Joker and not rage or playing stages with moving platforms
fell asleep in my chair after streaming now my back hurts Ok no more one mores
dbfz team soul searching
Tweek analysis from LTC7! Might do a DBFZ lab stream after depending on how tired I am :o

sorry for not streaming im busy watching anime
"anyone who knows CRT stuff who can help me out? Got a local seller who has  ""Sony BVM 14A"" and a ""Barco 14 ADVM"" for sale.  Either of these good for melee? Idk if either of them support 480p and how big of a deal that is lmao."
"i feel like half of the tweets who mentioned were just ""LEFFEN WAS RIGHT/WRONG"""
"Live!  Streaming some ultimate online, then melee netplay :o hopefully i get some good opponents today :)"
me everytime you threestock someone in ultimate and they leave/kick you
"A couple thousands of dollars later,  the leff lounge is finally a lounge. Streaming now!"
"sorry no stream today, i was busy going to ikea and buying shit for the new leff lounge :) pics tomorrow!"
Good video for everyone to understand why ledgecamping is degenerate.
Watching Hax's Video on Ledge grab limit then Melee practice!
Ultimate Practice + Albion analysis! Then MELEEEEEE come thru
analyzing Mkleo and why hes the best and if joker is broken then watching albion to see gluttony defend europe!
Ultimate would be twice as good of a game if thanos snapped half the cast
Online for a bit then Albion + CEO analysis! focusing on joker today!  Then Kaizo Mario maker levels :)
"gonna be streaming in a bit, analyzing albion/ceo and playing some PT online, and then kaizo levels in Mario maker 2 :o"
"streaming ultimate! Albion analysis, pokemon trainer online suffering then MM2? Kaizo levels?"
"been so bogged down with bs (paperwork, moving in etc) + streaming everyday so its been real nice to just chill today. big sleepy now"
MELEE grind Smashcon future winner  talking ledgeplank stuff and other bs
Mario maker 2 racing with Zaik 2 setups running going to see who can complete hard courses the fastest
Offline Pokemon training with Zaik then MM2 Races! Got two switches and two capture cards to run this Mario maker 2 setup later :o
"Pretty sad since I'm really fiending to play PT offline and upset some lameos, but itll have to wait."
"In case people missed my streams: I unfortunately won't be able to make Albion. Various bullshit came up (no not with the seeding lmao) so I canceled the sub goal before we reached it, but I will try to attend another Ult tourney to make up for it! GL everyone this weekend."
"our community can be really shitty sometimes, but it can also be great.  let's show that more often :)"
"Check it out! I donated to 'Join in helping oPrieZT and his family' - Uh automated tweet. Not sure what to say, but if you have some left over take a look and maybe help someone from the community in need of help :)   via @gofundme"
Mario maker 2 online is so bad it made me go play ultimate online
Offline Ultimate with Zaik! Then MM2 :o also talking about ledge grab shit
"this is great counterplay if we assume puff has one jump and one aerial with one timing and no other options. Don't get me wrong, wizzy did not play perfectly, but neither did hbox and look at the risk/reward for each option. How many times have u seen hbox ledgedash?"
Far from home was a great marvel movie
"Live streaming some Ultimate! Going to discuss Albion, analyze tweek PT vids and play as much online as I can survive"
tell me what team to use twitter
same reasons as before: cool game but shitty game online cool scene but europes is not active and even in america barely anyone grinds so feels dull wish it was different =/
trying and thinking about practicing ultimate actually just makes me sad lol
good stream it is very late now goodnight
"Playing a bit more Joker/PT for !Albion, and watching more CEO sets! (puppeh vs nairo/aba?)"
im so tired of telling people how to seed LMFAO whyyyyy do i always have to
why am i 17th seed for albion lmao
OK actually live now Albion subgoal / Practice! Joker/PT grinddd
"Nevermind audio stopped working, live soonish"
"ALBION Offline Joker practice :o almost reached the sub goal, going to try out joker offline and derust my PT!"
"Haircut timeeee Making some small adjustments for the summer, i hope they work out :w:"
"I had a ton of fun playing joker today pt too but even moreso joker gonna keep trying him out, really wanna test how he is to play vs good opponents offline!"
Gonna be playing some ultimate (online ...:o) and analyze CEO vods! CEO has me motivated to play joker and pt! Then mario maker 2 or melee!
"Melees competitive life has been forged out of banning stupid shit (items, stages, freeze glitch, wobbling to 999% etc). Slightly limiting an incredibly degenerate tactic that only 2-3 people  in the world ever abuse will not kill the game."
"I knew some people will be like ""just get good and stall back"" The reality is that melee and every other FG is almost as much of a spectator sport as a competition (just look at melee entrants vs viewer #) Our scene will take an extremely heavy hit if the meta is stall centered."
My next planned melee tournament is Smashcon and Shine atm. If youre a melee TO for those please dm me or respond here or in the top 25 group (made a post there yday). If other people can help compile data or videos of ledge stall heavy matches thatd be awesome as well!
I don't want to be overdramatic but I personally do not want to play in tournaments where the optimal play is to get one gimp and then stall for 7 minutes or the opponent kills himself. Hopefully there will be majors for me to attend this August lol.
"I hope the talks about a ledge grab limit don't just fade away this time. It's  obvious that Hbox spaces out his planking abuse so that it's not as obviously broken to spectators (intentionally or not). I've tried bringing this up with TOs, hoping for more responses soon."
Damn leo makes me wanna play Joker
Good shit Puppeh  LEFFEN WAS WRONG LUL
Watching Ultimate top 16 @ CEO! Talking Ledge grab limits and Melee results as well :o Mario maker later
"and before someone brings up ""but uh top platform"" top platform camping can be strong in some cases but its 100% beatable, esp with good usage of side platforms. Good planking (hbox doesnt ledgegash etc) is basically you having to win 30 times and if you mess up once you die."
PLEASE.
please add a legde grab limit thanks
fucko midsetcoachingu
"Watching CEO! Multiple Games, Ultimate, DBFZ &amp; Melee! labbing a little PT on the side maybeee"
BUUUMP  Please lmk :o
What games/streams can you restream for CEO?  @VGBootCamp @CEOGaming I wanna restream Ult Melee and DBFZ if possible :))
"""it cant possibly be worse than ultimate online right?"" this is every match so far. low ping 500/500 up/down internet"
"Super Mario Maker 2 is really such an interesting and great game, Nintendo really stepped it up and wiith all the new options you can make so many different things in the engine. Nintendo even managed to make an online worse than Ultimate's! WOW!"

"Etika and the way he went is a tragedy on so many levels. It's just so sad. Not sure what else to say, since I know that in a few days people will go back to being toxic ""for fun"". But at least for today I'm going to cancel my planned stream and take some time to reflect. RIP"
"I wish people would be kinder &amp; more emphatic towards people in the spotlight. Just because a person got a following doesn't mean that everything is great, and with how vicious people can be, when you are in a rough spot having that following can very easily exaggerate the issue."

Melee is so sick
Gz @Wizzrobe  Sponsor this man
GL to wizzy  Altho both of em are lame execution testing hoes But they were better than me this tournament so I can't really say shit. Cya at summit üòà
Think I proved a few haters wrong at least lmao. People really think that I have a shitty mentality just cuz I want tournaments to be ran better lmfao.
"That character +-+ oh well, pretty good run for my 2nd tournament back :)"
Big sloppy set Mentality came thru
i got my emote back
Excited to play today. Got a rough fucking bracket so gonna try to bring my best and maybe even prove a hater or two wrong ;)
Yo if any falcos wanna help me warmup tomorrow pls be ready by 11:30/12 :) @SSBM_Rocky @8BP_Frenzy @SsbmGinger etc!
Feeling a bit better after some food and time. Gonna do my very best tomorrow.
I made top 8! also i hate everything. streaming until food gets here
Still happy with my performance. my mentality was good even though I was playing like garbage many stocks. Playing vs Mango first thing tommorrow :x lets see if I'm decent vs falco again lmao.
"made top 8 through losers!  Since GOML I've managed to derust in the fox matchup but man I'm so bad vs Falcon right now. Missed everything. Wish we had good falcons in europe =/ Oh well, gotta practice that matchup in socal before summit, when wizzys on point i gotta play better."
Beat fiction 3-1! Lost a close game on bf but closed it out with a 4stock on DL.  Any falcons who can help me warmup now? @Zeodyne
"Beat techboy 3-0! Got fiction or shabu next, any good fox main who can help me warmup by station 1?"
"Update, 4 people in 15 minutes"
Lets see if this works...
"honestly tournaments that don't have closed off areas/vip areas are incredibly stressful and tire me the fuck out. I know (most) of everyone who come up don't mean anything bad but being bothered and ""having"" to say no so I can practice/recharge constantly is exhausting in itself"
"Not feeling like it at all today, but gonna do my best to make it to tomorrow. Just one of those days."
I need a fox and a falcon and an ics to warm up with todayy Hmu
late night  Time to sleeeeep
After hearing how much commentators make vs top players i have decided to transition to a full time commentator
So happy i decided to skip my pool lmao
Mango is GHOSTING ME
Still got a lot of things to try tho but its looking like its gonna keep getting worse if falcos learn how to get out of combos :$
"The more I play and lab fox vs falco the more I feel I should start working on the leff marth. Would be for falco and marth, maybe fox if others catch up in the ditto."
Sns is nice all around outside of the fact that the main venue is really hot and thus smelly
"Not playing ultimate cuz of schedule and delays. Also not feeling ult after all the over patching. Welp, another tournament."
are there any vip setups yet? the main room was so fucking hot/crowded when I went there
is there any way to play granblue at smash n splash :((
man olimars purple usmash is now -8  press F for all the input heavy olimar players =( will now be punished by some of the cast F
NEW PATCH REVIEW! SNS hotel stream :O
Actually its online only rip
Is there any way to play granblue at SNS??
If floating was so fucking bad then none of yall would watch summits
"I still think floating for top players makes a lot of sense for melee (NOT ULTIMATE or any game with frequent upsets). I know I'll get hate for this opinion but I 100% think itd make it better for everyone, with top players able to do signings/commentary day 1 and attend more."
"I personally love swiss waterfall and  round robin type for tournaments, as long as it doesn't screw over top competitors really hard. Fun to see SNS experiment!"
"Done with pools! No melee bracket until late saturday now, gonna try to play ult at 8PM unless jetlag hits me too hard :o PT"
First fox match of the day is always scary :0
Obviously I try to manage it best I can. Today is pools so I'm usually fine as long as I make it there.
"No real way to fix it than move to us or travel out way earlier, neither of which was am option for this event."
Made it to my pool... Idk how I always manage to not get DQd with this level of jetlag lmfao
So Tired
I just hate this culture of :oh my main good buffed -&gt; good patch! i have lost to someone playing a char that got nerfed -&gt; good patch my char got nerfed?? -&gt; bad patch
At least my chars (PT and roy) are in a better spot but still zzz pls fix online
"Just like in smash 4, the most likely scenario is that the current top tiers stay top tier and keep getting hits to KO power at random timings. Terrible for anyone playing competitively."
"Worst part about the patch is timing tho tbh. 3.0 was not long ago at all, for there to be constant balance changes inbetween dlc chars and with no fixes to online and other modes... Yeah I'm so over it."
Nerfing kill power of top tiers has to be the most boring way to balance a game possible.
"And just fyi I already decided after pound that I wouldnt play much pichu, i already thought the character was too inconsistent/got camped too hard for me.  Might stream and elaborate. Idk."
Happy theyre fixing more multi hit moves at least. Overall tho I don't like how theyre balancing the game tho.
"Snake also got buffed, zzzzzzz"
ya lets nerf pichu in 10 ways and leave inkling untouched LUL
(its a 2 and a half hr drive)
Best way to get from chicago to SnS? Can I really uber the entire way?
"Moving day after I get back, super hypedddd"
"Omw to smash n splash, staying all the way until summit! Feeling pretty hyped, still rusty but gonna make sure im back to 100% by summit!"
"internet was down for a bit but im backkk last kitchen stream, leaving for SNS in a few hours!"

THE LAST KITCHEN STREAM - anime tier list + practice! leaving for SNS tomorrow and moving so its time to say goodbye :(
"Tournaments are really hard for the stream, both for the days I miss but also since I'm forced to stream practice so much before, so I really appreciate everyones support lately :)"
"Happy people are enjoying the melee streams :) trying to focus more on the essential shit recently and so unfortunately ive had to stream mostly melee practice, more variety/chill streams will return after smash n splash is over!"
Lets get good - analysis day? gonna practice some shit and watch some good melee
"No stream until tonight, gonna watch john wick :)"

Summit review + Smash N Splash subgoal! talking about what I think about the Summit Merch this time (last time was a 1/10 lmao) and who I think should get to summit!
"i still want a gamecube controller overlay thing does anyone make em. I have an arduino for Ult training mod, can you use that one for it? (I tried before and it didnt work). PLS HELP"
Summit review + Smash N Splash subgoal &amp; practice! esketit
Stream is live! Going to rewatch Ultimate GOML sets (since I missed all of them) and review Melee Summit stuff!
"since I already went to GOML last week and I'm going to the Mango + Summit week after + apartment shit I think it hopefully should be understandable why. I'll be streaming a lot to hopefully make the subgoal though, SmashNSplash is a great event and I hope I can make it :)"
"To note: I would enter Ultimate as long as schedule allows me, and play PT since I didnt get to at GOML. It's a bit unfortunate that melee is hitting record numbers yet the top players are getting paid less than ever (relatively). I'm not going to do this often, but -"
"Incase you missed it, I'm subgoaling going to Smash N splash. Reasons are simple: 1. you lose a ton of money going to events, even placing 3rd, so a subgoal helps prevent the bleed. 2. recently bought new apartment, so it'll be tight with time. 3. Already got my summit flight."
tweet
THE RETURN - GOML recap and Summit review!! come talk to the 3rd place hbox 3-0er/the 4stocked buster
fuck you guys never 3-0ing hbox again gonna keep letting him 6-1 mango instead going back to watching anime ops only
"New YT vid out! This one goes through how I practice Smash, and more specifically goes through my melee/fox routines and how I view improving in general. RT and let me know if you want more content like this :)"
I have a decent sleep schedule already YE BOI
"I'll probably go more into depth on this in a stream soon cuz I gotta sleep, but yeah learning new shit is so fun and fulfilling, even if the subject itself can suck at first."
"Been learning so much recently since getting everything ready to buy the apartment. It was really hard and frustrating in the beginning, but now that I've made some progress I'm just appreciating how much left I have to learn about things and how interesting that process can be."
This is what I came home to lmao Lime please
Why does everyone advertise granblue versus but me Where is my privilege
Wow i guess im retired!!!!!! SAd!!
Retiring from tournaments until I get 5k subs and or 20k donated to my paypal Ur choice
Made $700 for 3rd Got 4 stocked by mango Lost 500 subs  And I have to look at this fuck Feels bad
What is there to do in toronto Got a few hours today. Any good shopping spots or restaurants?  But first a drink with a lucky falco player...
Like imagine how cool bran couldve been if he didnt look like this when dropping bombshell lines
Like fuck that episode did not need to be 90 minutes
"For real tho, game of thrones couldve been great but it just wasnt. Honestly my biggest problem is the scene pacing, every actor but tyrion is just blankfaced for 10 minutes straight."
"Drogon just went: ""dont hate the playa hate the game yo"" Lmfao"
Is literally anyone i know going on the boat lmao Dm me
Are people going on the boat or nah?
Where are people at Anyone watching GoT
I feel like everytime I take a break from melee I come back loving it even more lmao
Mango is a lucky fuck tho
It wouldnt been right if I won this one. Melee doesn't lie
Couldve done so much better and won if I had just played a few hours a week. I'm fucking stupid. Oh well brb grinding more.
"AhhHhh so rusty, I really feel it vs chars that execution test me now in friendlies. I was able to hide it well enough in tournament but I can't let myself take this long of a break from melee again."
"A lil salty over my sds and giving away a couple key stocks by going to the edge, but thats just melee tbh."
My mission this tournament was to just perform well enough and I feel like I did that and then some! Gotta grind more for Smash N splash now :)
"Ahhh, played awful in the fast matchups this tournament! Those are definitely the hardest when you're rusty, and I let it get to me hard.  Should've tried to slow it down but its hard when Mango and Axe are playing so on point! Pretty happy all things considered. Melee &lt;3"
Wooo
"Melee top 8 starting up, playing hbox in winners semis soon    #GOML2019"
"When is melee top 8, heard 2 differemt things"
PUFF PLAYERS ASSEMBLE IN THE VIP ROOM
"GOML Hotel RECAP - I made top 8 winners!! gonna order food and talk for a bit, come thru"
Other than that tournaments been amazing tho. Happy to be back in Toronto and the matches have been amazing
Happy I dropped out of ULT because of this. It's not okay.
Goml schedule like many others needs a lot of work. Playing at 11AM all the way until 10PM+ and then playing at 11AM again (ult) is not acceptable at all.  Worst thing is that its an easy fix if you just played ur r2 pools right after round 1...
I need jigglypuffs :(
Any puffs who can play a bit tonight?
Zain vs Amsa :O  I want both people to win
These sets are something else lmfao
Both a testament to how good peoples punishgame is and how much my defense has been slacking tbh
The amounts of people zero to deathing me is crazy x_x
"Top 8 winners at my first melee tournament in 6 months! Super tense set vs Zain, I somehow managed to clutch it out . I love this game :)"
Any marths who can help me warmup?
Talk about a back n forth set! That matchup is so sick
Falcos pls come to vip area :(
Any good falco/foxes wanna practice now :0
"By the vip setups on the right if theres anyone,  behind the curtain"
Headed to venue now! Any puff who can help me warmup?
I'll still try to play Ult at future majors but when I'm tired/sick I gotta prioritize melee for now. Sorry
"Lmao fine I'll guess I drop out, played my first match and won it but I am too tired feel like no game sound ultimate is worth and seems like everyone wants me to sleep :) I'll be back in time for melee r2!"
I wanna drop out of Ult to sleep but i dont wanna be a meme lmao
When do I play my 2nd round of melee? Both me and lucky heard lile 3 different things...
"Made it out of pools in Melee :0 Playing aight, lots of tech flubs but keeping it together still. Ult next, idk how itll go since I havent practiced since pound! Going to go p much PT only for the fans."
On main stream in like 2 sets
I made it to my pool!
üò¥

"Melee POG Headed back now, hope I can sleep :("
"Adapting to the new controller faster than I expected as well, bless @n3zModGod"
So happy to be playing melee again even tho I'm rusty :)))

Jetlag has been fucking me these last couple tournaments. I didnt have any options this time but gonna make sure to fly out earlier from now on so this doesnt keep happening.

"Gonna check in now and nap a little, then try to stream/play at the hotel. I'm at the gladstone hotel in downtown if any good melee players are around and wanna play :)"
waiting to check in to my hotel zzz sooo tired
"watch people take this seriously already:  ""LEFFEN U CALL UR PERSONALITY A 10? MORe Like 6/10 with a 0/10 in MODESTY"" fkn 0/10 intelligence fuckers"

i have like a gazillion followers on every platform pls send free stuff!
how do i find people/companies who can give me free furniture and tvs - i mean sponsor and be a part of the luxurious leff lounge brand.
"On the way to GOML! Extremely exhausted cuz of lack of sleep and everything with the apartment, but im gonna try to do my best and focus on getting back into things over short term results. Got my new controllers just now so gotta somehow get used to it asap. Still happy :))"
gonna do a short LEFF LOUNGE CELEBRATION - leaving for goml soon :O trying out my new @n3zModGod controllers as well!
"Just in time, the Lenovo Leff Lounge coming soon ;)"
signed all the papers (for now) and im walking around the area around the new spot and its soooo nice and peaceful yOOOo
leff lounge celebration stream in like 1 hours :))
Icing on the cake is that I managed to close it the day before I leave for GOML so I'm able to go! I still don't have my controllers and I haven't slept for 24 hours almost to close this deal after a 10 hour stream session lmao but fuck it LETSGO
"(obviously im not buying the full apartment in cash, but a big boy downpayment to make sure the month to month is low and enough saved up for a rainy day)"
"Huge thanks to my sponsor @TSM and all of my supporters, you all literally made this possible! Who could've thought Melee could get you this far :')"
I've been saving up almost everything i've made to buy an apartment ever since 2014 where I was working full time retail and playing smash + streaming full time. super happy with how the apartment and the deal we got :))) been streaming from a kitchen for far too long LOL
ya boi DID IT won the apartment war 5-0d that fucker still got some paperwork to sign but tldr the LEFF LOUNGE is coming

subscribe to me so i can buy the apartment. #GETLEFFENOUTTATHAKITCHEN Great deal I swear
Saw the nicest apartment today üò© Let's hope I get it :)
"also for reference, I did beat trif and ice in nov/december at two tournaments   so i have still won and entered shit in the last 6 months if thats the metric ur gonna use"
"For me personally, I'm not even 100% confirmed for goml (visa stuff, dw) and my @n3zModGod controller still hasn't arrived so I'm not exactly expecting to perform super well for my first major back, so I definitely think putting me lower is fine in this case."
"(thats his only major since summit) That said, if people want to force people to attend more tournaments by doing ""only the last 3-4 months count"" or whatever I think thats fine and I'd even prefer it, but there needs to be a standard that has an offseason and thats communicated."
"Like, I don't think you should be punished at all for not attending anything during late november - late january (genesis), especially if you live far away from majors. We need an offseason. If say, amsa didn't attend genesis, he should IMO not be seeded way lower for GOML."
"For my melee goml seeding - i think I should be either 4th (if use like 9 last months), but 6th (below zain/axe) if u highly value attending tournaments this year. If I did it I lean more towards 6th.   Honestly there should be a standard for major tournaments tho."
i rage at online i gift subs - Entering Ult at GOML???  playing some ultimate until i get mad then melee / persona 5 :)

Why is false allowed to tweet Like Why
Gonna try out some KID GOKU fucking finally maybe some melee practice after depending on how degen I get :)
"To even run the event we had to have someone on the east coast restream it because spectators cause lag, but i guess we shouldnt mention that since the game got many entrants at evo"
"The brawl/smash4/ult community has a big case of this - if melee players don't try the game, then we are being melee elitists who only want melee. If we do try it and spend thousands of hours on it, and grind harder than the ""smash 4 pros"", well then you just used it for MONEY"
"There's definitely a big victim complex within some gaming communities. If you don't play every single game for infinity, then you can't critique it because you haven't done enough. If you do play it a ton, and then find flaws that make you dislike it, you're BETRAYING YOUR FANS!"
"Like what, we're just supposed to not talk about the online and act like thats fine? that watching Olimar vs snake is insanely hype and cool? that 2 framing and rage are good mechanics? If people didn't accept that type of shit it'd be FAR more likely to change."
"real talk tho, fuck people that think I'm trying to bring ultimate down.  yeah I'm burnt out and I have a lot of complaints, but I have always said that it's just my opinion and if people like it thats great.  It's a video game, shitting on the flaws of it immoral or wrong at all"
ya i was nothing before ultimate how does it feel to lose to someone who has litteraly never played a smash game before :O
stop telling me that i got added into fortnite üò°
"very tired today :o been sleeping on and off all day, and trying to enjoy it instead of being stressed out about it :)"

swole bros this is not an invitation for unsolicited advice
exercise is annoying and hard :(
just thought id tweet this so nobody thinks its someone fake claiming my name or some shit idk here it is if you want to look at literally nothing of value
"oh yeah i launched a (placeholder) patreon today just so I avoid the fees that will start for everyone launching after tomorrow. not planning to use it in the near future, maybe someday if I focus more on youtube or do set review if you want to support me twitch is better :)"
"I feel like half of ultimates chars are really boring by design tbh, and most people only like watching duck hunt, samus and pac man etc do well because they are rare,  because they are just as campy and boring as snake and olimar for me. Idk maybe thats just me."
"I don't think Snake and Olimar are that oppressive, but the fact that ultra defensive characters with terrible movement who use like 3 moves for 99% of their neutral and have one combo each are doing  well at all makes me sad. I straight up just don't watch matches with them."
got spoilers  havent watched an episode since s4 and even im mad
"happy thundersmash is running a bit better... I want new events with high prize pools to do well obv, but man it was really so funny earlier today LOL"

"Japan &gt; NA talk, analyzing Umebura (JP Major!)  Mortal Kombat 11/Melee grind after!"
(not to mention the MASSIVE advantage of 95% of all majors being NA as well)
"japan is definitely looking like a far stronger -overall- region for ultimate, and maybe even better at the top top level. it's honestly crazy (and a little embarassing for NA) considering how few of their top players are full time. gonna talk about it in depth on stream today."
anybody wanna play games :(

"a little PT for the fans - then MK11/Persona 5! going to TRY not to be mad about ultimate, gifting subs if I whine."
"i hope people realize that just because ultimate isnt my favorite game/community of all time doesn't mean that i think its terrible, and the reason why I try to bring attention to the problems is because there is so much potential there. i really hope to be proven wrong"
"uploaded a video on my currents thoughts on ultimate, my two biggest problems with the game and why I'm not taking it as seriously anymore. mostly just made this so I can refer people to it when they ask why I dont play as much Ult anymore  be nice"
"(i know that most of them are just ""feels"" type players, dont take this too seriously please...)"
i feel like every time i try to talk melee with a puff player i come out of it thinking that the character is better than i thought LOL both funny and sad :)

#healthymorningworkout with a #healthysmoothie #nashville
had fun streaming persona 5 today!
playing the CURSED GAME offline joker play hehe
ultimate FUCKING SUUUCKS lets play persona instead
its TIME PERSONA 5 playthru so I can be a better joker main
STREAM IS BACK! smash &amp; mortal kombat! gonna start downloading MK11 now and play smash until then!
FuUuuck I think I forgot my melee controller somewhere =( if anyone has seen an emerald controller with notches and black shoulder buttons (probably at @XanaduGames ) let me know :(
"Headed back home now, stream returns in 30 min!"
"100% worth the freedom but still, stressful as shit"
had a productive paperwork coffee shop visit. being your own boss is hard :(
when you block someone and later click on their profile to see them still losing their minds about it
Why are people taking this as me complaining that end game isn't spiderverse... Y'all are stupid
Personally I just want more focused and creative movies where directors have to worry less about tying in to a greater narrative and are allowed to change the tone/act structure. Into the spiderverse was insanely good and I hope it paves the way for more interesting movies.
"[ENDGAME DISC NO SPOILERS] Even tho end game wasn't my favorite movie or anything it sure feels weird for it to be over. Overall I think I'm happy that they will have to come up with new things do make movies about, the consistency has been good but it's definitely getting stale."
"[ENDGAME REVIEW, NO SPOILERS] endgame was good but definitely worse than infinity war for me.  The cheap jokes coupled with the runtime left me feeling almost nothing for the end. Plot holes galore but well... Overall impressive they didn't fuck it up."
see i misspelled tattoo what if that happened to my body the horror
one day i want a tatoo or ten but i have literally no idea what itd be and i wouldnt get one without being sure about it for years so yeah ill post it here when im 80
best hot sauces to order home?
"i might still stream some mk11, but gonna take it extremely chill and go shopping and watch endgame today so no promises"
i am taking it so easy today and it feels amazing
Slept more 13 hours after getting home and now my sleep schedule is decent yayy
do i play persona 5 now or wait
FINALLY home Time to rest up and take better care of myself.
flight brb
"I don't need a game to be as hard as melee, but when you play in ultimate its 5% learning how to do something and 95% fighting against the buffer and online, it makes it feel like less about improving yourself."
"I really miss practicing execution. It's really fun and legit theraputic for me to practice it and it adds a ton of variety to practicing, rather than just grinding matches. To practice something for hours and hours, to hitting it in matches and then tournament is really special."
"In the current meta however, there's a ton of different characters making relatively deep runs that give pichu a lot of problems, and even in matchups you should win, its easy to lose if you don't have exp. Parry buff also hurts a bit. I think pichus peak is the highest though."
"I personally would use Pichu more as a counterpick/secondary rather than a solo main, simply because of how volatile the character is and how many matchups there are. There will definitely be some big problems if olimar/snake get more common but otherwise no top tier counters."
"As for pichu, I think currently pichu is clearly not THAT strong results wise, but its a hard to master character so I expect it to change eventually. pichus MU chart is pretty lopsided in general, with some insanely good matchups against top tiers but some bad mid/low ones."
Definitely slept on super solid character either way. Absolutely insane frame data
Dont fucking tag dark wizzy or im blocking u LOL
It might be sleep deprivation but I think mario might be better than pichu
good thing about not taking ultimate seriously is that i can just mess around and get lowkey sick with slept on chars and play pokemon trainer since thats the most fun. however i cant test any of the characters properly because of online so zzz maybe not.
i want to lab melee but my controller adapter is checked in nooooo im trying to lab ultimate but then i just think that whatever cool things i found isnt as good as olimar usmash oos and i just get sad
joycon broke so gonna wait with MK11 until I get home and can stream it. Excited to try my first NRS game!
is mk11 fine on switch might buy it there for a portable version lol
mortal kombat 11 on pc or ps4?
very happy to see @EG_PPMD doing better :')
cant wait to get home and relax and setup better routines for myself :o
Airport attempt 2
Still fun to use but abuses matchup knowledge too much for me to main. Secondary?
"If you don't know the matchup and hes good vs ur char, its basically GG. Very stupid imo but thats what ult is designed for."
"Big flaws of his design for me are: You can just charge smashes vs counter and react. Gun is 90%air downgun and 10% annoying chip damage. Grapple is so terrible, basically useless against good di. Arsene Up B is terrible Side B is very underwhelming once they learn to play vs it"
"10 hours of playtime joker impression: Solid midtier with a lot of counterpick potential. In many matchups arsene is not that scary and hard to get, and in others its the complete opposite.  Cool combos will not happen in 90% of matchups, sadly he is mostly pokes + arsene."
"fun streammm Helped me kill a lot of time until my flight, got some nice joker/pt clips haha. Ggs @zd_luigi"
"Live again! More pound recap, snake / olimar / joker analysis, and playing with @zd_luigi !"
The puff guide will be anti puff LOL
I think I should do character guides on every good melee character at some point for Youtube.
"If you need ultimate frame data checkout   Not paid endorsement lmao, im just so happy it displays shit like shield adv and does so clearly."
"Got flight stuff figured out more or less, gonna be staying another day. Likely headed back to xanadu to stream some more :v"
What a way to end this already exhausting trip :(
Missed baggage checkin by literally 2 minutes after everything. Likely no more flights today and everything tomorrow is like $2500 God fucking damnit
I still think Snake &amp; Olimar are not as strong as others think they are and that they will get worse with time - but obviously I also realize that my month 1/2 opinion on the characters was definitely off the mark. I blame wishful thinking LOL
"Ordered a new guy, yes only 2 min away. Literally not moving. Been 5 min and now 3 min away."
He fucking canceled.
Might miss my flight because the uber guy is taking 30minutes to get here fml
talking about my main problems with ultimate &amp; its competitive scene
"POUND RECAP! Olimar, Snakes and crabs gonna be talking thru everything that went down, my thoughts on ult&amp;melee etc! starting now"
"Yo my flight doesnt leave until 8, so im gonna be at xanadu from now on. Anyone wanna play my joker/melee fox :)?"
i have read so many stupid fucking things on the internet this past weeks and ive so been exhausted and its taken its toll on me but at least I can be proud i made it through and tomorrow I get to go hooooomeeeeeee
Ultimate afterparties are as packed as the ultimate setups at majors
Afterparty is lit Snake vs Olimar to Sicko mode
Remember that olimar got buffed in 3.0
Rooting for leo/sam/marsss Lesgo
when theres 3 snakes and 2 olimars in top 8
that said i mean ive never been hit by a crab in ultimate Thats fucked up
FUCK PUFF i mean obv im coming back this shit cant continue
Man.  Maybe i can live with ultimates online after all
Whens Ultimate haha
mango Pls
DUDE MELEEEEE
PLEASE MANGOOO
"(u can very easily 2 frame up b and its worse for edge guarding in most cases, and counter is better for recovering before arsene)"
Joker is so fun but also wack af sometimes Why does his recovery get way worse in arsene mode LOL
IVE TWEETED CONSTANTLY ABOUT HOW MANY MUS THERE ARE TO LEARN AND I MYSELF USED 3 CHARS IN BRACKET TODAY I D I O T S LOL
You guys seriously are so sensitive LMAO I just ment to meme since randoms always act as if melee is all fox dittos.
oh wow guys melee doesnt have as many characters as ultimate on the char select screen u really got me!!!
How does melee have more character diversity than Ultimate already LOL also the character lineup is... üò®
Never heard a tournament this big be this quiet :/
"They have japanese top players working on the patches, but they obviously don't have any sway, just like how Nintendo of America doesnt."
I really believed this time that Brawl/Nintendo had changed their ways but that's what I get for being an idiot LOL
Part of it is because of how horrible the patches are IMO. Balancing around elite smash and not fixing any of the core problems of the game makes me realize that nintendo doesnt give a shit about us. As if the items on tournaments werent enough.
Oh ya im obviously going to play tons of joker on stream
I have so many complaints about competing in Ultimate but I'm gonna save them for now so people don't see it as salt lmao. Next stream maybe :)
(so I have time to stream and play melee etc without burning myself out like I have been)
"Did well enough in Ultimate to feel satisfied for now. I know I could do better if I stuck to one character/spent more time in America but I don't think that is worth the cost atm.  Hope you all enjoyed me competing in Ultimate, still might enter but not going to practice anymore"
"Blah I couldve won every game, if only I had a bit more pichu practice :/ Oh well, respectable I guess. GGs ultimate."
"Wew, did it. Happy I believed in my adaption skills and didnt try to swap chars. Next up is MkLeo :v"
"Lingling next, got no idea on who to use lmao"
"I don't think joker has a playstyle where you spam 1 strategy for most of the match, but thats probably why hes not top tier"
You get a hit.
"Same issue, greninja has cool stuff but 95% of the time its dash attack and nair until"
Pichu can be sick but 95% of the time its just thunderjolt and the same 1 combo I do well (relatively) with pichu but I already don't enjoy playing the character much.
Obviously
Obviously gonna try my best but I'm obviously still exhausted as fuck and I don't think I have it in me for a losers run
Playing winner of esam/captain zack/lingling At least I can take an respectable L and then take a fucking break from this game LOL
"JW hit me with some sick shit, def shouldve went pichu right away but that matchup is mad volatile and I hate dying at 50 LOL GL further!"
Lmao I woke at 8am to play like that  :v Lets get this losers match asap
for the fans
I MISS THE PASSION
"I forgot Ultimate players don't warm up. Not a soul here for ultimate, 5 melee setups up tho LOL"
"Any greninja players who can help me warm up? Headed to venue now, gonna be playing up by the stage"
10am pools is one thing but 10am top 32 is straight garbage
First match tomorrow at 10 AM x__x
For now I'm gonna do my best in this tournament. I'm exhausted but I owe it to everyone to try to make a run.
Its honestly mostly because online sucks so hard. To be good in Ultimate while living in Sweden I have to sacrifice melee and for me it can't compare. I really need a break.
I think I just don't like Ultimate as a competitive game or the competitive scene as much as for dbfz/melee. I still like it as a stream game and I love some characters in it (PT/joker) and obviously I love competing in general but I don't feel much passion for the game atm.
I've played PT Roy and Pichu this tournament btw lmao
"Man I'm playing well with all my chars in Ult but like I don't know if I will actually have fun long term with any char outside of maybe PT Think I just need a break, watching this melee has me entertained."
Any greninja players who can help me practice for tomorrow :v
"Oh im done for today, playing at 10AM tomorrow instead."
"that MU is super polarizing, got some momentum and managed to run with it. Playing MkLeo slayer JW next"
Remember when people said edgeguarding wasnt that good in Ultimate
Leo DQd out of losers
"Jw (canada, ontario) beats MkLeo 2-1 Game 1 was greninja wolf, Jw won Rest was greninja v lucina, all matches last stock"
Most likely playing ZD next on stream. Not sure to go PT (fun and got exp but its one of PTs worst MUs) or Pichu (good matchup but no exp)
"Somehow won pathoran (snake) 2-1 with PT. Got fucked in the first game, last hit game 2 and won solidly game 3. Matchups in this game x-x"
Not feeling it tbh. Going to play PT for funsies I think.
Made it to/through my round 1 pool in Ultimate. I wish joker was legal :(
Almsot esam yikes Lucky he got a game he wouldve been memed into existence
Going to TRY to make it to ult pools tomorrow. Depends on if I feel better after some more sleep or worse. No promises but it would be good to get some more ultimate experience.
Been pretty sad about this whole situation but hanging with people today in person made me feel a lot better mentally. Thanks guys :)
"melee is the best Somehow tired again tho so headed back to hotel, ggs."
If I had to guess hes prob high mid tier to bottom of high tier. A bit too hard for the amount of sauce.  Still love playing him tho :)
Honestly Joker seems like a character thats going to be very inconsistent and matchup based. If the opponent plays around his tools well (esp counter) and how well they can play around arsene mode.  Still got a lot more left undiscovered so his tier placement is up in the air!
Side B whiffs  Rising bair will miss anything thats not point blank Usmash whiffs even in arsene Sh guns whiff Fair whiffs Uair loops dont work on floaty light chars (olimar pichu etc)
Joker is actually WAY worse against  short boys. Tons of things whiff. Probably kills his viability as a solo main :v
aight clout check time
do i try to get into venue with no badge :o i kinda wanna play joker friendliess =(
is badge pickup still open? Thinking about heading to venue but no badge :v
somehow slept another 7 hours
"Just to clear things up, im most likely not entering Ultimate tomorrow either. The reason I 100% dropped out of melee and not ult was because melee was today but since I'm feeling bad still its looking unlikely that I will play tomorrow."
"woke up with a sore throat as well :( guess this just proves how stupid ive been regarding my own health, proud of myself for making the call last night. Idk how bad id been feeling with 5 hours less sleep rn"
goodnight
"i know i shouldnt bother reading reddit but that shit is fucking hard. being thick skinned when youre already mentally burned out is even harder, id appreciate it if people stopped stating the obvious (reddit is not good)  its just got me down and I felt like sharing it."
This shit right here is one of the main contributing factors to why competing is stressful in the first place.
"me: man everyone is being so understanding, i cant believe i was scared to be honest with everyone  *checks reddit* ...right. thats why"
in more positive news i got some cool joker combos today on stream. stay tuned for a highlight vid and my long guide i did today.
"i'm gonna make sure I make the changes so I can stop this from happening again. I hope people realize that me dropping out of genesis melee was the TOs not planning for someone playing both games and not me being lazy, lol. joker honestly came out at the worst possible time.."
competing at pound  Read:
Ok who at xanadu wants to play my joker RN
Doing my joker guide now! Going through my thoughts on the character and how to play him
Live with more JOKER gonna do my guide on him soon then offline practice with him!
extremely tired but headed to xanadu now Stream soon
Who wants to play my joker  at xanadu
Well I guess its today lmao In like 6 hours
Gonna sleep a few hours now and then head back over to stream more. If u wanna grind ult or melee tmrw ill be at xanadu all day
"Honestly not really that interested in competing in Ultimate or Melee for Pound. I just wanna spam Joker. Gonna enter melee at least tho, gotta support and itll derust me a little. Ultimate is a maybe."
"no real charizard buffs is kinda meme lmao flare blitz still misses in the air randomly too, only changed ground version"
No fixes to multi hit moves is honestly hilarious. So many moves in this game dont work properly at all. Parry buff vs projectiles is best change imo but not huge or anything. Mostly a nerf to ivy/pika/pichu and a few others. No changes to rage/2framing as well is zzz
The balance changes were honestly awful for the most part. Nerfing shield damage for projectiles and not even shield advantage makes very very little difference for pro play outside of zoner vs zoner matchups. Buffs to Corrin/Sheik/Mewtwo were good but not enough imo.
"Outside Joker, 3.0 patch is really underwhelming overall. Stage builder is very limited, could be a ton better with only a few extra options. No online netcode changes speaks for itself. Embarassing. No one with a capture card is going to use the video editing in 2 months."
I love joker prob going to main him cuz I think hes way more fun than most and I'm feeling lukewarm on super tryharding ultimate from sweden anyway.
ACTUALLY THIS TIME
joker concept 100% di will mess with this I think a lot of it is still very very useful
I GOT HIM FINALLY
JOKER IS OUT PT BUFFS?? STAGE BUILDER?
my sleep schedule might be rip BUT now I can stream a lot of joker On soonish
man i really fucking hope jokers up b grapple is a good combo move /extension shit is giving me voldemort zss vibes
HYPED for persona music and stage builder as well! please let us make our own blast zones :((
also fucking hell nintendo u rly gave him a down b counter
"no online changes is big sad tho. balance changes are likely coming as well, gonna be hype."
joker looks really cool! hope his limit isnt too rage based... but i do love that he has an interesting mechanic. his movement with gun seems awesome as well :D cant wait to play him tomorrow!
JOKERRRRRRRRR
Landed in mdva! Too late/tired to enter xanadu but I might stop by later for stream/friendlies.
"hope yall dont take this as me saying the game is shit, its still a good game for the most part. It could just be a lot better and its frustrating that way lmao"
"Not making any decisions or anything, esp since 3.0 is so close, but I really just feel like playing melee even tho im rusty and shit at it now. Excited to try out Mortal Kombat as well since that actually has good online."
"I think I'm just a bit burnt out on it, and I miss playing melee and having free time lol. Ultimate is a good &amp; fresh stream game and good competitively too, especially if you enjoy variety in matchups, but as a competitive game I like DBFZ and Melee significantly more still."
"I have fun every time I play ultimate offline but the game has some  problems for me, and I'm not sure I love the game enough to justify traveling a ton and practicing online just for it. I really hope 3.0 makes some big changes (not nerfs) and improves the online tbh."
"JK no sleep instead heres a hotel stream with Quik, Mr con con and gluttony!"
"(ive known for a long time that I could lose to PT, and I knew mouthbreathers would be toxic about it. Doesn't mean I regret my decision to not play the char in the slightest)"
"Obviously the internet is going to be extremely toxic cuz I lost to a person playing PT, go figure, so I'm gonna sign off for now. Gonna play some more at MSM then head to Md/Va tomorrow for bootcamp and Pound! Ill attend xanadu if I get there in time."
"My pichu is really awful vs heavies still, I keep doing stuff that would kill mid weights and I risk too much against their kill moves at low %! Gotta study how void and other pichus do it."
"Beat a meta knight 2-0 then lost to Zeal, good PT last hit 2-1! Good stuff, died in some really stupid ways but thats on me not being good in the matchup. Karma I guess LUL"
Having fun with ultimate whenever I get to play offline regardless of the result lol Online so bad its weakening my competitive drive lmfao
Blaaaahhh I couldve had that game one if I just knew how to ledgetrap olimar! Great olimar exp at least.
"Beat K9!  Shuton next, any olimar who can help me warmup :0?"
Finally got some friendlies in vs zaki! Chrom is OD vs low tiers :O
you know how fucking happy id be if I could play 9am-5pm at a major? LOL id never complain about it being early. and thats not considering how much more stressful top level competition is compared to an average job.
"real talk: people that bring up ""oh its at x hour, dont complain that is early"" all fucking forget that smashers often have to keep from 10am the day before until 1am the day before because of bad schedules + delays.  stop being so stupid pls im tired of this debate."
PRIME SAGA Recap + MSM Practice! gonna analyse some of prime sagas best matches and prepare for MSM!
when does msm start? anyone down to play until then?
I miss u @zerowondering
Like when I lose in melee at tournaments I care about I'm fucking crushed. My entire existence is just suffering for a while LOL
"I feel like in melee/dbfz it was the opposite, the top players are always very passionate and take losses to heart. Maybe people just don't show it in the same way tbh. I gotta get good soon so u'll see some controller throws when I get 2nd ;)"
is it just me or is it low/mid level players who get salty in ultimate after losing at majors lol. Saw a ton of people get mad for not making it out of pools but I feel many top players don't really seem that sad when they lose. It's weird to me lol.
"(for ultimate, if i just mention melee a fox player just appears next to me)"
"ok finally found a place to play ultimate :) if you ever want to play me when im at a major, just ask, im literally tweeting about wanting to grind every day and i cant find people lmao"
"PRIME SAGA RECAP strim gonna talk about the matches, maybe some analysis, and how im feeling about ultimate right now!"
Anyone playing?? Its only 8 I wanna keep playinnnn
LOL but ya japan got us all this time. I think theyre grinding way harder.
"Olimar is still one of the worst designed top tiers ever. Pretty cancer. See that ""nose""? Thats a tumor."
Shuton is a beast
if i play against pacman im just fortfeiting tbh
wyooo @Mr_RSmash  insane usmash plays EUROPEBOYSS
"(this isnt me being good, its just him being worse LUL)"
MORAL VICTORY
wait did I outplace salem? LOL
"it makes me feel a lot more okay with taking the long road for ultimate, and being okay with not placing well yet LMAO"
"like, i know how fucking disgusting ""fans"" can be when people who they are used to seeing win underperform. But imagine having to go through that, on his scale, for that many years, when everyone called you washed and a has been. crazy shit."
"say what you will about tiger woods, but coming back after everything he has been through and through everyone doubting him is fucking inspiring."
"First tho, SLEEEEEP"
Sucks to be out early but first pichu tournament and I got plenty better already. Gonna try to attend MSM tomorrow and play lots of friendlies today! Thanks for everyone being supportive :)
"Wish I couldve practiced the fox matchup before, had plenty of practice with PT but I wanted to go for long term gains since the PT matchup is rough as hell once they learn it. Had I known he had a snake I wouldve fuckin went PT tho LOL"
"Bleh, lost to megafox 3-1! Rough game one but won confidently 2 stock game 2, then he CPd snake on me (LMAO) and I lost last hit, then last hit vs fox game 4! Happy I got exp in the fox matchup, its def one you cant play off in at all or u die to nair usmash at 60 with pichu :("
"Beat a good ness 2-0! Had to clutch last game hard with an offstage spike. That matchup is real weird since u cant tjolt much. Winner of megafox vs ako next, any fox players around lmao"
If I look/play like shit im sorry
man i am so fucking tired ROFL Taking every bit of willpower I have to get out of bed and not fortfeit.  I swear to god if things dont start on time I'm going back to bed LMAO.
doubles isnt over yet and bracket starts 10am tomorrow lmaoaoaoaoaoaoao
i miss melees grind culture so much maybe i just need ultimate clout
Anyone grinding friendlies tonight?
Aight any good players wanna grind some friendlies
"Anyway I made it to bracket tomorrow thru losers. Hopefully I'll be less tired, gonna try to go on a losers run :)"
If I wasn't okay with it I wouldn't be playing a game with this many characters. It's gonna take a long time before I'm comfortable in every matchup since I didn't play 4 but thats okay. It also makes playing players worse than u/pools a lot more exciting :)
"Just in case someone took my earlier tweet about matchups u dont know wrong - I actually don't mind weird matchups much. Obviously I prefer games like Melee/DBFZ where its more about fundamentals than MUs but my mindset is, since I already play those, Ult is a nice change of pace"
"Also yeah I know that u can hitback gordos but idk how to in practice, never played a d3 that actually mixes up the timing like zaki"
I cant believe his bair does 23% and kills me midstage like that Jeeez
"the heck is that character LOL. I had no chance vs Zaki, hes way to good for me to challenge him without exp. Part of the game tho, it happens! Gotta hunt him down for friendlies later haha."
The FUCK do i play against zaki LOL
d3.... Oh boy
BrOo i just first tried a robin off stream
Playing ultimate in matchups you dont know feels more like fighting a badly to decently designed single player boss than a test between two   players to see who can play the best lmao Sekiro has prepared me for this LUL
my poor pichu got fucking bowlingballed please press F
in round 2 i lost a game to a villager Never thought a tree could grow that fast and kill a poor pichu at 30
Also rip tsm lol :( tough one
Starting pools now Somehow even more tired but excited to get some more tournament exp :)
so fucking exhausted still luckily i got pools at 6pm
Gotta take it easier on the streaming leading up to events :/
"been exhausted this entire trip, i think streaming so much at home and then traveling 20hrs has taken its toll. Nothing severe yet but I'm going to take it as easy as I need to in order to not burn out, so sorry if I'm not around to take selfies/sign stuff :("
pre major tournament at the same tournament venue has to be the wackest shit smash 4 players invented since no DSR
chill ultimate stream playing some online and watching some tournaments!
are people playing at the prime saga venue/hotel today?
my sleep schedule =(
I just need to learn matchups then im actually gonna be good lmao
Played offline pichu and  :))))))
"US Smash fest with Mr R, wizzy &amp; socal peeps"
Until FGs get better online (not only pure netcode. But ranked/trainingmode/tournaments as well) this will always be the case.
About WC/wherever getting more opportunities in FGs: Duh. Living in a good region is by far the most broken asset to have. Its much easier to become a top player playing a low tier in a good region than a top tier in a bad region.
If his fucking down b is a counter you are DONe
If joker is a fucking sword character i will quit ultimate i swear to god nintendo
top dbfz player Big homie Dm now :)
1 hour uber to practice ultimate  AMA
Playing some Melee with @C9Mang0  Ironman?
BIG Leff in the US / is elite smash better here? gonna play some shitty online ultimate but this time in california then melee netplay with mango and more and then maybe offline ult? live now
who wants to play in socalllll today?  melee or ult
so tired aftet trip dont know if ill ever feel like working again lmao
Anyway im in LA wew wasupp
"3 and a half hours in customs, 2 of them standing up, all with no phone or anything allowed zzZ"
online tier list
doing the ONLINE TIER LIST come in here and talk about how much better the game is online!
"Leaving for the US tonight  soon! Chill stream, talking 3.0 leaks, online tier list maybee"
i definitely miss being a competitor and the melee scene in general. gonna be nice to be that for a bit even tho ill stream and be rusty during my next us trip.
"i think i just need a break from the online circus around ultimate.  its cool to see a lot of new and young people come into the scene and its definitely a great scene overall, but man the downsides wear on you over time.  gotta put my head down and just be me for a bit."
"maybe in 3 years  or so people will finally stop acting as if every single match or set won by a PT is definitive proof to me being right or wrong about everything ive ever said  lmao, as if."
i kinda wanna talk about who im playing at prime saga/pound and what im thinking for the patch but honestly with how incredibly toxic people are about my own character choices im just gonna stay silent sad but too tired of this shit tbh
some more off stream practice is definitely good tho playing on stream is too draining and really inefficient for learning
if ultimate had better online id consider it lmao i need someone to whine to xd
i just played a few hours of off stream practice for the first time since ultimate came out  and man i can be so much better at this game if I didnt stream hm..
"my schedule has just been so off lately Hopefully itll be better in the US, leaving tomorrowww"
slept like 15 hours ama
"Doing analysis of Suplex City starting now! Going to go through some PT matches, some nairo matches, and some Chrom matches :)"
live with Ultimate! Going to do some analysis from Suplex City and other recent tournaments! Also new pichu emote??
pichu is the cutest thing alive prime saga practiceee watching tourneys (no restreams)
#NewProfilePic
shorty ulty practicy streamy
Melee is so sick ty for tuning in gonna try to sleep :v
just some melee (and some ass)
STREAMING ULTIMATE sub goal to bootcamp for prime saga in socal! and then melee practice for pound!
mob psycho is some 10/10 shit
also isshin the glock god fucked my sleep schedule =(
finished sekiro high highs and very low lows lots of good ideas with bad execution but when everything clicks its great not gonna give it a score because fromfanbois are gonna swarm me but yeah hope they make a sequel and improve the formula!
"First playthru of Sekiro continues now - Almost done, headed to last area !"
back with some MELEE going for rank 1 on anthers ladder :o
WHO WANTS TO NETPLAY MELEE WITH ME FROM EUROPE‚Ç¨
POUND MELEE PRACTICE with ya boi @zaik_ssbm
NEW PATCH WOW!! JOKER NOT OUT! (NOT CLICKBAIT) PICHU STILL HERE! gonna practice some ultimate/melee with zaik :)
also can i just say that perfect pivoting is possibly the single worst way to give a game micro spacing lmao
that said: Heres my personal list of things I hate. parrying is way too badly implemented. the edge sucks. 2 framing sucks. rage sucks. No DI+SDI sucks. Multi hits never working properly despite no di/sdi?!?!? Dash dancing feels awful. Buffer. Grab sucks. Online. Stages suck.
i feel like comparing month 4 ultimate with year 4 smash wii u with tons of dlc/patches will give you some skewed takes. I agree that I ultimate doesn't allow for as nuanced/deep/offensive/hype gameplay as it could have tho.  ...if only there was some other game that had that :)
OMG NEW PATCH IS COMING NOW JOKER IS COMING FOR SURE (CLICKBAIT)
"chill day, some online then sekiro &amp; melee! feeling a little meh today so gonna try to keep it easy"
ty for the help :)  gonna stream in a lil bit
Positive stream! Online Battles :D 4.5MILLION GSP!! :) Ultimate SMASHIN live on teh twitcher!
i was considering maining joker but after looking at the trailer again im not so sure - the way he holds his dagger seems low tierish
you know after seeing PTs doing so well and winning so many majors ive come to the realization that PT is actually top 5 and charizard is pretty good
bro after thinking about it kh3 is actually an alright game
legit forgot
shit i cant tweet this on april fools
21 was worse before the patch
DizzyChicks123: pkmn Trainer isnt bad the fact the pokemon trainer has good result means he has no idea what he is even talking about
gonna play some melee and talk some about battle of bc/maybe analysis and puff/ics lmao
"keep in mind: this is rulesets/tos fault, not changos. hes 100% innocent lol"
like i seriously dont feel like playing melee when the ruleset allow/encourage this stupidity. not trying to force TOs into making a decision they dont want but yall cant make me play at a tournament with this shit either.
banning wobbling but letting puff timeout half the cast for free LUL
#makepufflosetimeouts
Pichu/Roy practice / Joker leaks talk! also getting serious with melee practice tonight :o
can u restream battle of bc?
I cant get out of bed
ye boi
i cant believe the 5am club closed at 4:45 i am heartbroken
we have been at this club long enough to watch the playlist loop I cant tell if its a good or bad thing
the Boys
a few drinks with the boys and MELEE
bro piccolo and 21 are perfect for each other now @HookGangGod
3.0 WISHLIST - WHO NEEDS BUFFS?

"still grinding pichu :)) Enjoying him a lot, pls dont nerfff"
Going to play some Offline Ultimate starting now! Excited to try out Pichu offline (trying him out but not commiting until after patch) and finishing up 3.0 wishlist after!
time for some POSITIVE PICHU PRACTICE (PPP) then dbfz/sekiro/melee later!

21 IS FINALLY GOOD? LEFF DBFZ RETURN NEW PATCH DROPPING IN 20 MINS
PICHU/roy practice + 3.0 buffs/nerfs wishlist finishing
run with the wind was actually so good definitely the best sports anime ive seen after ping pong
we dont have much time lefts for memes and streams lets make em count boys
sEKIRO watch me rage
3.0 BUFF/NERFS and Pichu practice :o sekiro and/or melee later! full bloom analysis as well
going to do my best to never appear on any stream that is ran by clash tournaments and not attend tournaments that hire them not demanding others do the same but seriously fuck them and anyone who supports them
also clash tournament has still not pulled back their copyright claim vid has almost 300k views now and is making them money  Do I take it down to spite them? seriously how pathetic can one be
chill day grind night Stream soon
aight doing my Ultimate 3.0 patch wishlist/predictions starting now! also maybe analysis for Full bloom analysis?
finally back with more ultimate took way longer than I thought but ye lets play online until i cant stand it
"and no im not gonna do that, but it seriously makes me feel like advocating for good changes within the community is so time consuming and thankless that it isn't worth it."
"really makes me realize why so many politicians and public figures etc turn corrupt and selfish even if they were in it to help people to begin with.  everyone just assumes you're as bad as the worst of them regardless, so you might as well get the benefits of being selfish."
"its depressing how often i'm accused of only criticizing and ""whining"" about seeding/rules/whatever for my own gain even when i've consistently done it in cases where I wasn't affected positively or at all for years now. They really believe everyone else is as selfish as they are"
theres not a single char that can actually reliably threaten to timeout puff Closest thing is YL if they suck at the MU its not really relevant for the fox mu but srsly puff just deletes 90% of the cast if they play decently + lame enough
please make puff lose timeouts her camping is far too strong against floaties and chars that cant approach/laser her idk why its not a rule yet
online practice + Full bloom preview! come here
Commentating some Full Bloom with @GARMAKILMA
yo @BTSsmash is anyone allowed to restream Full bloom?
Congrats to @thebsktrbbit for winning the @GEICOGaming giveaway! Here's me with the flag :v
elite smash until i rage then sekiro until i rage then melee
female joker main btw
today i will play ultimate until rage and then sekiro until rage and then melee forever
i just wish sekiro had a decent camera man is that really too much to ask after 125326644 souls games
"zzz at fucking idiots who think/act as if i hate everything because i dont love their favorite game series as much as they do I love a lot of games - recent good games ive started playing recently is offline ultimate, valkyria chronicles, ff9, celeste, hollow knight and dmc5"
"inb4 ""the game is just too hard for leffen thats why he hates it!"""
"if you love dark souls youll prob still like this game at the very least, and some will love it."
one of the funniest/sadest things is that literally no one can agree on what dying/reviving/reviving then dying actually does
"sekiro is both fun and very frustrating (not in a good, challenging kind of way either) hopefully sekiro 2 improves on the formula, not sure if ill keep playing this game."
a VERY brief recap of stupid smash drama then sekiro!! very good game yes
u know what maybe its time to start playing dbfz again  this shit is getting out of hand
huh
Starting Sekiro! really excited for this game
perfection 2.0
ROY MAIN BTW GET IT
#NewProfilePicture
roy matchup chart 2.0
Thinking about who to secondary + Roy labbing. then melee or SEKIRO?
"Taking today off, cya all tomorrow."
took this morning/afternoon off in procrastination and i cant stop feeling guilty about it even tho i streamed 12 hours yesterday and literally havent had a full day off in 3+ months  being your own boss is a curse and a blessing ill be on after dinner :v
just please nerf superdash
dbfz patch notes üò©
why is everyone playing sekiro but me
twitter is doing its best to show that  it can be a cesspool too on this post.  sigh.
"I wish I was exaggerating. Its both hilarious and sad to see how even mods act as if just because other places can be bad, that means r/smashbros is fine."
everyone:r/smashbros is consistently the most toxic website and they dont do nearly enough to change it  r/cancer: wELL thats JUST what happens with ANONYMITY!! OTHER PLACES have been toxic too!!  DID YOU KNOW THAT REDDIT ISNT ONE PERSON? Why dont u mention THE GOOD DISCUSSION!!?
MELEE
Still playing offline ult Still hating on clash tournaments Now with more Zaik
Playing some ultimate offline! Working on my roy and trying to nail down my secondary...
doing smasher merch review
talking about how clash tournament SUCKS might play a little ultimate after then some melee/dmc5
"To do this and then promote zeros vid just shows theyre on some ridiculous power trip. It's literally shooting themselves in the foot too, top players bring in the majority of your views to your tournament vods in the first place and we often dont get links Fuck clash tournaments"
not dming clash tournaments out of principle. They are literally abusing the system and breaking fair use law. Content stealers such as smasha and rebaz suck but abusiving copyright claims puts you on the same level as them.
so fuckin over today good night
having to ask for permission to do analysis on tournament vods is honestly fucking ridiculous. Gonna have to DM sakurai to complain about online and DM square enix to say KH3 sucks too
going to sleep now hopefully its resolved when I wake up.
my recent analysis vid of Nairo vs Light was MANUALLY claimed by @CLASHTournament  pls explain
"back streaming going to talk about potentially quitting Ultimate, R/smashbros (aka r/cancer) and then play melee."
"real talk: I'm not sure if ultimate the fighting game is good enough to the torture that is literally every other part of ultimate (shit cpus, shit training mode, hellish online)"
ELITE SMASH UNTIL I RAGE then melee :) might do a character guide or two as well!
Next time im banning self promotion
link me fashion brands to checkout while im bleaching this hair
"Stream once im done, gonna be playing sone online ultimate... And then lots of melee :)"
Haircut time... Finally.
i sure do love me some elite smash!! Subscribe for more gamers!
ELITE SMASH UNTIL I RAGE  then melee first time playing online ultimate in 2 weeks =(
reviewing nairo vs light vs ganondorf
Analysing Collision Top 8 now! is zss &amp; ganon broken now???  is yelling coaching? wow
Offline Practice + Collision Review!
no yelling literally anything once will not make any set be replayed stop using shitty slippery slope arguments for a very nuanced situation
If coaching happened throughout the set and marss tried to contest it earlier then IMO it should be replayed (lol). Wishes imo should also tell them to stop. real fault is at TO should stop it earlier tho.
this is my perspective from someome who only heard second hand info.
if wishes wasnt in on it and it was only one game of mild yell-coaching then imo the game should not be replayed. Guy who disturbed the match should be thrown out of the venue obv and if Wishes was in on it then he should be dqd too (i doubt this was the case tho)
Whats happening at collision
"ROY Matchup chart TLDR - very underrated chars who stomps almost all non top tiers and has some good top tier ones, with no really bad counters. his meta is still very underdeveloped tho so this one is more up in the air imo"
"pokemon trainer MU chart factors in that they are harder to play , for example ike is even on paper but far easier for him to execute his gameplan."
doing Matchup charts for both PT and Roy now on stream!
live with more ultimate!
Gonna stream some more DMC5! just getting started with Dante
...might subgoal battle of bc 3 :o
"not going to Full Bloom anymore =( sorry, I really wanted to attend but its a bit too soon after Summit and I got a bunch of other shit I need to do atm, and the flights over there are expensive and long. Going to look into attending Prime Saga and Pound instead to make up for it"
ELITE SMASH (:() + Summit/Mkleo analysis  gonna go review all that I learned from summit and analyse why MKLeo is destorying everyone atm
Can someone give me a good recap of the big changes in the dbfz patches and how they influence the meta?
gonna play some offline smush! Looking into secondaries today and gonna talk about what I learned at Summit - and try to implement it!
Trying out Greninja :o playing some offline ultimate!
jetlag stream Back from Summit! - Greninja lab?
jetlag has beat me once again
also (lol) how reliable are his grab combos and how badly does he get fucked by good di?
Also im curious what u think about the inkling mu
Vs
What are greninjas bad mus? Feels like hes a good char to use vs small boys that roy/wolf sucks vd
Back from Summit! new mains :O? talking summit etc
starting DMC 5!
Back from SUMMIT! Recap + DMC5! lets talk about all the stupid/funny shit that happened during summit! also super excited to play DMC5
lost like 600+ subs on my summit trip not counting ads/yt/donos/bits god damnit lmao
"before i always gave people the benefit of the doubt ""uh maybe he doesnt realize how toxic he is being"" but those fuckers are in 99% of cases either 1. intentionally riding that line or 2. so stupid theyll never realize how toxic they are"
(if you dont want to be blocked then just dont be toxic and/or tell me what to do if I didnt ask for advice) its really not that hard but well
been blocking so many toxic fuckheads on twitter and it feels so good everytime
Slept a ton after getting home Getting out of bed at 2am lmao jetlaaaag Summit recap/dmc5 playthru stream?
Dmc 5 on pc or regular ps4?
what a night...lmao
i am struggling SO HARD to stay awake
God damnit
Mkleo
im starting to believe olimar is good
More commentary?
Oops
On commentary for Glutonny vs Zackray!
Like sure my opinions are wack sometimes but wishes thinks pt has no losing matchups Whos really delusional here
"Real talk, if you wanna play PT then great. Im far from the best player here and I've only lost to people better than me in tournament - but yeah I think PT has a lot of bad matchups and loses me matches. If you think thats just johning when im speaking my mind then fuck off."
real talk tho how the FUCK do people still think PT is top 5
"Honestly a bit relieved to be out, I can finally drop PT for good and keep grinding. If I had suceeded in gimmicking more people then my choice wouldve been much harder lmao. Excited for my next ult tournament!"
"Did pretty okay this summit regardless. Played fine against everyone but summit but ran into two matchups I currently have no exp/answer for.  Literally only played vs small boys, fucking roy sucks vs them :("
"My roy was playing like absolute garbage today + 0 matchup exp vs a little so thought I'd try to cheese him. Damnit lmao, if I played better I couldve pulled the gimmicks off. GGs void, out at 9th."
Tips vs Pichu?
Shitty way to win but oh well I beat plup 3-0
EUROPE
tips/vods for roy/PT vs greninja??
Anyway gonna sleep now since brackets early af tomorrow. If I lose early I'll do plenty of commentary if people would like me to
Roy might stick around too of course if I feel like hes needed. For my other char I'm thinking one of inkling/fox/wario/pichu and peach.
I think picking at least one common character is my best way to improve since online is such absolute garbage and I'm good at analysing/ stealing shit. Obviously people will bully me for not having a main figured out in 3 months but yeah welcome to the sad state of the internet
"Got a lot of ideas on how to improve going forward. Definitely replacing PT as a secondary but I think I might also just play wolf instead of roy. Not because roy is bad at all, hes still top/high tier for sure, but because I can learn a lot more from vods since roy is rare."
"Playing and learning from everyone this summit has been great but I just hate sucking (and playing charizard) lmao. I can really feel the level up coming tho, even if it doesnt show much in tournament it really does in friendlies. Picking a simpler char has helped a lot."
hm who do I use tomorrow
not playing mafia fuck you i wanna practice for bracket not die day 1
do you ever just wake up and wonder why the fuck you arent playing wolf
"In losers for tomorrow, gonna try to make a run but it'll obv be very hard with how good everyone is. Just gonna keep grinding till it gets easier."
"Dabuz was easily my worst matchup here at summit, so not too sad about the result. I'm pretty used to unlucky seeding thing LMAO"
"Did fine against dabuz, with how hard the matchup is combined with my lack of of matchup exp. Can definitely play better though."
Anyone got any tips/vods for roy OR PT vs Olimar?
"the gimmick lives on Next up is dabuz, roy kinda sucks dick vs olimar but ive never played the pt one Hmm"
This matchup is sick
people be sleeping hard on zero
Melee players do so much worse in tournament :( WE'LL GET THERE
i think i get even more tilted by losing to inkling Fuck that stupid ass character LOL
Gonna try to play better from now on but honestly im playing so fucking bad recently and I have no idea what characters to pick so im assuming im going to lose to literally everyone at this point and just try to get some experience. Sorry :(
so sad i wasted so much time with this fucking garbage character Got no other chars to play vs inkling and playing armada next GGs hello losers
pokemon trainer is clearly top 5
i hate exploiting peoples lack of knowledge to win but i gotta do it for now lmao
my pt is putting in some work but It definitely feels like the character has an expiration date (when people learn the matchup).  Gonna need them for quite a few matchups that are here at summit tho.
"Got really fucked up in ultimate today, everyone knows their shit here and my play, especially with roy, was honestly really bad.  My lack of top level practice with him is hurting me a lot. Learning so much tho, and I'm gonna do my best play better tomorrow. Let's get it."
anyway i think im gonna quit playing mafia at summits until people get better and i dont die/get checked night 1 by default. honestly just a waste of time to wait for everyone to go through the rules for half an hour to die anyway. cya in 10 summits lmfao
bam obvoiusly played far worse but assuming that people suck is the #1 rule of playing mafia with noobs lmao
"also zero majorly fucked up by not bringing up that the medic should save him, saying that town played well is a big yikers"
"wait am i the only one who noticed how insanely town favored the mafia ruleset is btw lmao we used to play with 2 kills night 0, now its 1 kill day 1 lmao i wanted to note this but they didnt announce it before the game began and it wouldve been an obvious mafia move to whine lol"
Wait how did the medic not save zero LOOL
Now I get to practice so im happy
its impossible to carry in mafia when theres this few good players lmao. always gonna die/get checked night one lmao GL my mafia bros i did what I could
Being peer pressured into playing mafia when I wanna practice :(
"I just tried, swedeswapping doesnt work in squad strike.... Thats so unlucky lmfao"
WHY DIDNT MY SWEDESWAP WORK LOL IM TILTED
MELEE MELEE MELEE
I blame the commentators
Playing bad :/
Melee chant growing stale  Itll be be funny again tomorrow tho
"Bleh, the fox/pichu matchup is annoying but i played okay at least. Needed to take way more than 3 for us :("
I suck rn Gotta step it upppp
Do you want me and @zerowondering to host a podcast
Zero is the latest  Melee player at heart
"(i hope no one takes actual offense to me saying i want people to work harder - ive been like this since day 1 in every game i play - melee, dbfz, and now ultimate )"
wew what a stream cya all tomorrow let's grind tomorrow ;)

"Had a lot of fun today, learned a lot. Tomorrow is the real grind day. Lets get it."
Ty for watching  Ill take u back tomorrow stream
Playing with Light!
THE LEFF .5 STREAM IS LIVE use !multi for all 3 streams
im convinced the sonic movie is just using outrage marketing Genius really
im on my way to mangos after a fun shoot with the fortnite boys :)
Some are well drawn but some are... Well not.
im sorry but... really LOL what are these necks/ears
"(close in terms of placement, i still think peach/inkling/pichu are significantly better characters than even other ""top tiers"") I just gotta figure out how to play vs small boys"
I still am a big boy roy believer Such a good character Not top as good as the absolute best but very close atm
PT will do as a secondary for now tho! I'll see after the patch if I'll swap them for someone else. Unlikely that they'll be the best choice tbh. Got a bunch of ideas I can implement with them now that I'm better overall so its nice to do push the character a little again :)
"Playing better and better, but so is everyone else. Gotta improve faster... Definitely on the right track tho. Played some PT today, was fun for sure, but nothings really changed about my opinion on them. Once people finally learn to play vs them its gonna be so much harder."
I never thought I would play against a character with a more broken dash hurtbox than Melee marth but here we are Xd
Does anyone have hurtbox display for inkling? i legit cannot hit them lmfao
Playing roy/chrom/pt vs ya boi @ArmadaUGS
Lmaooooo
Mango almost died :0
LEFF &amp; @C9Mang0 ULTIMATE summit .49  stream
dont drink two coffees at once kids
quick nimbus/summit talk /analysis stream before I head over to @C9Mang0
Whats happening
"Well deserved for Light tho, almost made it in thru Genesis and now came thru with the nimbus win."
light has some insane plot armor WOW
gotta find a secondary after the patch fox just might be in the running now LMAO im lowkey inspired by light and zd
damn zd
What are the restreaming conditions for @2GGaming lmao Might do a quick stream while I wait for my food
cant we just all agree that both roy and chrom are sick
Lets go Raminnnn Eu/chrom/roy boysss
"Anyway I just hope this performance was decent enough to get some of the ""JuSt pLaY pT"" morons to shut up. I already feel like my roy is on par and its 2 months vs 1 and a half weeks lmao"
"Learned a ton from this tournament, the summit level up has already started! Got so many ideas and areas to improve in, and I played like 9 matchups ive never played roy vs!"
He is harder to play vs small chars because of how they seem to always sourspot but I think once I get more exp I'll adjust and do better. Chrom is always an option if I feel like its too hard!
"Also roy is good as fuck, i just suck with him still. Missed like every single jab bair setup and always picked the wrong move out of spotdodge which led to me missing a ton of kills. i also suuuuck at ledgetrapping with him still!"
"Definitely a matchup where ill eventually look into chrom, but I know I couldve won with roy too. Just played really stupidly and got antsy when I needed to kill. Overall fine performance for my new ass roy tho."
"Meh, no excuses for that one. i just played so fucking badly! GL to everyone, out at 9th"
wait stroder is sick respectable loss YES EGO BOOST
my phone boutta die so leme just say entering was good practice regardless if I buster out or not
"I beat Zenyou 3-1! Avenged mango lmfao. He played mario, another matchup I've never played before, the game I lost I died to fthrow cape at 0 LOL"
"Shouldve stayed roy in retrospect, the few friendlies I had vs istudying two months ago were not the same matchup at all LMAO"
"Blehhh, had no idea what to do vs greninja. Didn't play around the characters strengths at all with roy and my PT was mad crusty lmao. Good practice for summit tho! Gotta get ready for plubber"
How heavy is he? Does roy dthrow nair work lol
"Vs Stroder next in WF I heard he plays greninja, never played one with roy Give match help"
I'm happy the best characters in this game arent as wack to play vs as the rest lmao
what the fuk is this game
Bleh I'm so bad at hitting small chars with roy
"Still feeling foggy with a headache, ugh jetlag. Gonna try to play tho :)"
Also how do I combo fox from  throws lmao it was so weird
"For nimbus tomorrow im gonna be playing as long as my jet lag isnt too bad, slept really weird on plane so we will see. Should be fine tho, worst case ill try to force my way on to commentary ;)"
The roy is coming around :o Neutral is coming together more and more. Still need to work on looking for combo starters and defense tho. Super excited to play and learn from everyone this week.
Headed to the nimbus hotel - gonna head to @C9Mang0 s at some point after!
hello los angeles
"oh ya the single player games I ended up buying were  Transistor Final fantasy 9 Valkyria chronicles 1 (50% off atm) i'll let you guys know what I think, pretty sure i'll like these"
"Traveling to tournaments is almost always a big hit to the stream, so I appreciate everyone that stays subbed, but don't feel pity for me, I'm fine with a hit financially for this amazing chance to improve ingame. I'll be coming for your primes when I get home tho üòà"
"Sorry if the streams on my channel and YT are inconsistent though, I'll do my best to do some hotel/irl streams tho! When I get home I'm going to be back streaming a lot more consistently, gonna make a serious effort to make up for the subpar streams this month :)"
"Headed to America now! Really excited for the opportunity to grind offline smush with the best - ult online has been making me so salty lmfao. Going to stream as much as I can, gonna be at Mangos/Summit a bunch tho so tune into those if you want more leff :)"
analyzing mkleo vs tweek from frostbite finally

#NewProfilePic
grass starter is the cutest one doe
same energy
"ive given smash shit for the same thing many many times btw, smash 4 and ultimate shouldve innovated more too. but dont let logic stop butthurt pokemon fans :)"
New pokemon games look just like more of the same old tired formula in better graphics. Big sleep.
diehard community that constantly showed up and played their game. good game too. nothing but respect.
"also im very happy unist made it in, you can watch my stream if you think im lying or backtracking"
"Really tho, can we all just appreciate how die hard and invested everyone is in Melee?` I feel like regardless of what happens, good or bad, theres no community as tight knit and caring as the melee community. As long as that doesn't change the game will never die."
"Honestly tho, lets please not get toxic. There's still a fair chance we will be back next year when they come crawling back :) Let's just redirect into other summer majors, I'm sure there will be plenty."
melee boys where we droppin
No EVO for Melee is sad but definitely not a huge blow to the community honestly. They prioritized games that paid them to be there instead of viewership or community support and thats sad but its also reality.  Melee will be fine. Let's celebrate no Bo3 Majors this year.
EVO LUL
EVO LINEUP REVEAL / ROY PRACTICE
Going to play some Apex with the boysssss then royboying it up after in ultimate ;)

Shoyo james and goblin repping my new shit tooüò©
Especially happy people are putting in work with squirtle and ivysaur nair setups def something I need to do more too! Charizard tho...üòÖ
"People who seriously think I'm salty others do well with PT... Lmao. It happened with 21 too. If theres people who are better than me with the character and show it can be done thats awesome for them and good for me, means I have another main to play if I want to :)"
Shoutouts to @SSB_Ned and Wishes (someone tag him!) for repping and pushing PT forward! Follow them to support the sickest character :)
leos footsies and timings are crazy good Goblins roy used fulljump super well damn Taking so many notes
Home from pheonix blue! I wasn't there much but the venue was great. Restream of frostbite mby later tonight.
what are the restream conditions for frostbite? @ComeToFrostbite
seeing PT lose because of charizard makes me feel 30% happy because i dont have to do that anymore and 200% sad
headed to venue nowww I know ult top 8 is happening but if anyone wants to play leme know lmao
happy to see america get bodied on their home turf tbh lets go japan
do not let this clip fool you roy and chrom are clearly mid tiers
so many upsets at frostbite i know the upsets are coming for me tooooo So many matchups in this game
Vine whip/ivy dair are the 2 most satisfying moves to hit FREE
seeing people die at 70 to ivy is why im still using PT for some matchups until people learn to play around it LMAO lets go PT mains
checkout this cool meme   via @YouTube
drunk hotel stream with the boys mario party maybe?
does anyone at pheonix blue have alcohol i can buy LMAO everythings closed
Dont get me STARTED on the duck hunt matchup WOW

Dude ROY Is so fucking goooood
"if you guys think PT is top tier - great, i wish I did too. pt is the most fun character so it sure is strange that everyone putting them high either dont play them or dont do well with them :) i seriously hope im proven wrong tho, would make me very happy!"
CLEARLY YOU WERE WRONG ABOUT TRAINER LOL YOU WERE JUST JOHNING ABOUT THE CHARACTER TO MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BETTER LMAO IDIOT LEFFEN HAHAHA  btw went 2-2 at my local yesterday with PT so i actually know what im talking about btw
leffen youve been playing roy for 2 days and it hasnt gotten 17th at a major yet wow HUH SHOULDVE STUCK WITH TRAINER IDIOT
üôÑ
"ive slept/degened in my hotel room for so long now needed some time to rest up  gonna head down to venue down and maybe stream, ill keep u guys updated"
"In malm√∂, headed to venue now :)"
Does anyone have frame data for lucina and chroms aerials on shield?
Headed to @PXBSmash now to grind more friendlies today! (reg closed) Going to be streaming from my laptop (as long as im allowed lol) so tune in for some sets with top eu players :)
Swapping around/character crisis will definitely hurt my performance short term but I think I'll catch up soon. I think it's made me more well rounded too so I'm prepared in case of nerfs or big buffs.
"I might eventually transition to playing more swordsman chars such as Ike/Lucina and/or play wario for a few matchups instead of PT but yeah, thats all after the patch so gonna worry about that later!"
PT is still overrated af but people suck dick against the char for now so itll do until I have time to invest in a proper secondary. For now I gotta focus on learning Roy/Chrom and I'll decide on a secondary after the patch in april!
TLDR is Focusing on roy as my main for at least all of summit. Wolf or PT will cover bad MUs such as Inkling and Lucina and ones I don't know yet with Roy such as Olimar and Snake. Miiiight play chrom in a few matchups too idk yet.
Bootcamp went well all things considered. I didn't win many matches hehe but my character crisis is -almost- over and I feel like my fundamentals keep getting better so it won't take too long before I'm sick again.
up at night thinking about pokemon trainer
I wonder if theres a lot of matchups where ud prefer chrom over roy. Maybe lucina and inkling?
"Roy is a bit tricky but I don't mind, I like that he has a higher ceiling than some other swords. When u get going hes soooo good. Not used to playing swords in this type of game but it shouldnt be tooo hard tbh"
Roy practice went very well even if I started to play badly towards the end. Making good progress just gotta keep it up. Might need a secondary for the lucina but idk
roy is honestly maybe the best swordsman Def between him lucina ike shulk and wolf lmao
Reggie :(
I need some roy emotes RIGHT NOW
Def gonna be working on peach in the background  Too much work and risk of nerf to main right now tho
hot take peach and maybe pichu will eventually be in their own tier if they remain unchanged
Side stream is up! Roy/wolf main btw Use !multi for mic
Yeah if we used the same amount of money for x player we could send them to more tournaments. Maybe if those players actually streamed and used twitter outside of summit season they could raise funds. Summit just shows theres money in the scene.
"yeah you cant raise your venue fee because your stream sucks, you got no decent compendiums etc, and the average player exp is going 0-2 or 1-2 and then having nothing to do the rest of the event."
"""wow people spent x money on summit? omg they should spend money elsewhere!!!""  you morons dont get it do you. Summit actually brands their tournaments and makes it into a Event for each scene, if anything it just shows how other TOs and Players suck at branding themselves."
roy is actually so fun while still being relatively simple
"character crisis was mad real for a few hours today rofl Going to force myself to play either roy/wolf mostly until summit, dont wanna waste the learning exp!"
Send me all the royboytech
Roy+Wolf is definitely the move
Dude ROY
Gonna be playing meru and trying new chars in search of my one true main on the sidestream :)
"Glutonny is on stream, vote ends in 15!!"
big boy character crisis right now lmao
Live with the first day of the Penguin Bootcamp! We got @ArmadaUGS @MeruSensei @GlutonnySSB
"(i still like playing PT for fun tho, just cant enjoy them as a main if I feel they hold me back)"
"Gonna take a while to find a new main and get good again with them, but happy I realized now that PT aint even close to worth it.  The grind continues tomorrow!"
"Fun bootcamp day 1! Learned a lot. Roy is sick, wolf is sick, pichu is a bit boring. Young link is good but very hard, has a rough matchup vs wario so need a secondary for that. Pokemon trainer is overrated af and mid tier still"
Streaming the Bootcamp with @ArmadaUGS @MeruSensei  And @GlutonnySSB !
"New youtube vid up! Answering some questions about my last tier list, how to pick a secondary and more"
"In gothenburg now, starting the bootcamp today! Going to be confirming who Im maining for summit by playing a few chars im interested in. Young Link is the most likely one tho"
Going to do some Q&amp;A/ Comment review for my newest tier list!  Also prepping for my bootcamp with armada and gluttony tomorrow by trying out some new chars!
"NEW TIER LIST VIDEO IS UP! Longest one yet, talking about all the best and the worst characters, and who got the most nerfed in the 2.0 patched etc RT twitch prime and idk"
on me putting yl higher than tl reddit is filled with so many genius level top players its crazy!
its almost like i realized that i overrated a character and then swapped to a better one :O
"I rank PT top tier from day 1, and #2 before genesis. No one says shit. Put them in mid tier (called it low high tier initially, just easier to categorize).  ""leffen is just shitting on his own main to make himself look better!!"" x50  ...after ive already decided to drop PT üôÉ"

NINTENDO DIRECT HYPE
"streaming!  Nintendo Direct in 5 hours, watching that + predictions First summit Vote today! Discussing who I think should make it in. Tier list after direct? if I'm still awake enough"
its a weird fucking world when its more likely that nickelback is added to smash than having the game be playable online
can we stop talking about what dlc characters we want and just hope they stop making us repick your character between every match and get a netcode made this decade
after playing apex with people from california with no lag problems at all i just feel dread over having to play ultimate with 30 frames delay to practice tbh fuck ults netcode its so fucking garbage
who can carry me in apex HELP

"Feeling pretty sick btw, if I stream itll be nocam/nomic, might just rest tho :("
send me the young link tech pleeeease
"Going to be interesting to see the KH fans respond to this one... The response for my tweets/streams, while I may have a bit agressive after how mad the game made me, is still easily the worst fandom ive ever interacted with. Plenty of nice people - but sadly still a minority."
I was legit starting to think  Maybe I'm just cynical and not giving the game a fair chance Nahhhhhhhhhh
more proof @zaik_ssbm really is @vgdunkey  he watched my stream and stole my content!!!!
Thank fucking god theres another person feeling the same thing I do If you watched my stream I literally commented on like 95% of these LOL
bowling champ
anyway quit kh3 after the frozen world it aint worth it  thanks for laughing at it with me  Next single player game is celeste then dmc3-&gt;5
#itbegins #pintandahalf
I need to fix this I need my clone of the heartless data leff to travel back before I wrote the tweet to fix it in order to give myself the power of waking
"after watching several lore videos on Kingdom Hearts I now truly understand..... how could I have been so foolish?  Kingdom hearts 3 is clearly not a 3/10, its a 2.9/2 - a fragmentary passage - /10 the plot is fucking garbage i cant dislike the gameplay cuz i dont get it? LMAO"
sick masochist continues his first playthrough going to play some more KH3 lmfao too tired to play smash so lets watch some fucking cutscenes
my heart was consumed by the darkness if only i had played the mobile games everything wouldve been great
woke up with a cold the kingdom hearts fanboys have cursed me :((
its been a wild ride Did not think my tweets would get this much attention tbh Deleted one of the earlier tweets because it was came off needlessly aggressive. maybe ill finish the game on stream lmao Mayybee
same thing happened to nier altho my opinion of that game has actually improved lol. A LOT of people who don't love it stop before route C - and the ones who are fine with the games flaws finish it. Few actually finish it despite disliking the first 15 hours.
its the classic: game (series) is good but has a lot of flaws making a lot of people quit it. if you critique it without finishing it youre instantly ignored because you havent played all/finished it. But the far from the majority of any game finishes it thus inflating the scores
"Any and all critisicms I have of the game are instantly disregarded by fans because I haven't played the previous ones. It's hilarious, especially since theres a ton of people who will pick up KH3 as their first KH game or the 3rd one after 1/2 -plenty of ppl will be just like me"
"If you enjoyed it good for you! I wish I did too. I think the KH concept has a ton of potential. But if you think I'm going ""out of my way to hate on KH fans""... Bro its literally just a few tweets. Don't follow me if you don't want my opinion on a game I spent 7 hours and $70 on"
just fyi I've watched and read a decent amount of the previous games and I think I'd enjoy KH 1 for the story and KH 2 for some of the story and all of the combat I don't think I'd enjoy most of the spinoffs. The reason I tried 3 is because I had heard it called GOTY.
all i will say tho is that I hope sora isnt added to ultimate knowing how good nintendo has been with making the characters like how they are in their games he would be the one character even floatier than jigglypuff ;)
anyway im gonna get off twitter tomorrow i will have to block every person in my mentions with a sora/roxas avatar but that can wait until tomorrow
anyway the dmc 5 demo was fucking great only problem was it was too short really and that it could be like 10% faster cant wait for the full game
"you can enjoy the game of course but acting as if it has no flaws and as if everyone who has a problem with it ""just doesnt get it"" is so fucking hilariously stupid"
Honestly - only a person with 0 taste or blinded by nostalgia would spend their time and money to play all the fucking spinoff mobile games anyway If you think any critisicm of the game is null because you haven't performed the ritual of giving square enix 2 grand then LOL GO YOU
and yeah yeah surely i could only understand the super deep LORE and STORY if I had played 12 other games before it Surely that would make the combat better Surely that would remove the 3 seconds of awkward silence between every line Surely that would make Proud Mode hard Surely
and yeah fucking duh i havent finished it so im not giving the game an actual rating  KH 3/10 is the fucking meme because it literally couldve been the games fucking title and the fans would still praise it
"the game looks and feels like was made for the PS2 but upscaled and remastered for the ps4. the framerate is GARBAGE on a regular PS4 while still looking ugly as all hell. Putting the graphics mode into ""stable"" somehow makes the game lag twice as much......."
kingdom hearts 3 is an actual 3/10 game i haven't played the prior games but honestly i'm happy i didnt because waiting 13 years for a story and gameplay this garbage wouldve fucking ended me graphics dialogue combat its all shit Cutscenes and VA shit cost $70 LMFAO
Playing the DMC 5 Demo! because fuck KH3
ALRIGHT  HERE WE GO blind kingdom hearts 3 run proud mode lets spam x and laugh at silly story
"Young Link/Wolf? KH3 later-- tried some young link yesterday and loved it, lets do some more today :) also lets laugh at kh3"
"ive ""played"" the game for over half an hour and its basically just shown me the same scenes in hd and not hd. what the fuck is this story LOL"
I want to do better scripted content but its so hard to have time for it =/ I promise I'll do it eventually tho.
"like when I compare my view numbers to people who make wayyyy better content for me I feel bad, so many good youtubers out there. I need to make a favorite content creater video lmao  also video in question before anyone asks:"
"my video from yesterday talking about my new main(s) has almost 200k views in under 24 hours. what the fuck, that's actually so many o_o ...might be outdated already LOL i honestly feel like i dont deserve it since my yt is mostly edited streams but thank you guys regardless =)"
"alright,  here's my video on the proposed Jigglypuff/Wobbling ban thats been going around recently. Please watch all the way through. The topic is a lot more nuanced than people let on. People who don't and still comment with ignorant shit will be blocked."
alright lets fucking gets this out of the way full discussion on wobbling/puff ban
New main PICHU practice + Puff/Wobbling ban talk later. going to be grinding pichu/inkling/wolf/PT all day
"Regardless of your opinion of how good/broken puff/ics is and whether or not you want to ban/nerf them, this is a fact that needs to be understood before discussion can even begin."
Before anything:  If you think the number of players in top X proves jigglypuff/ics isnt Y then you are an absolute idiot. People don't play Puff/ics because they don't enjoy it and back when most now top players picked their main she wasn't considered the best (still for ics).
Going to talk about wobbling/jigglypuff ban on stream later. Tricky topic.
Here's a video on who my new main(s) are and if I'm going to continue to play Pokemon Trainer!
playing some offline ultimate now! grinding my new mains for Summit and talking genesis =)
live main(s?) reveal
"Back in sweden, time to stream again xd New main!? Celeste? KH3?  ultimate first for a bit then chillin with a single player game"
woke up back in sweden wew super chill celeste stream in a bit
I'm just scared of nerfs :(
"I think I've found a character that lets me do me, do sick shit while not being overly complex ü§ë"
I think I found my new main üòä
PS1 vs PS2 is a seperate discussion. Let's all agree to stop using shitty stages that have slopes or move first.
"One of the main reasons I don't want bans, especially several ones that reset after every game, is because it breaks the flow of the set. Watching players take 1 minute to stand up and ban the same two stages every game hurts."
You can not counterpick a stage you won on.  If you're a top player/community figure then you better speak up and make your voice heard about getting proper rulesets OR stop whining about them all day in person. You're just preaching to the choir.
"Again, use the leffen ruleset aka no shitty stages.  Starters: Smashville Battlefield Pokemon Stadium 2  Counterpicks: Final Destination Kalos Yoshi's Story  no bans. Up for debate on Unova and Town and City. Fuck every other stage."
"A part of me wants to just relax and have faith that someone else figures out the stage rulesets since I'm tired as fuck from doing seeding etc. But, sadly, I realized that the smash 4 community fucking played on TILTING LYLAT the entire time and y'all need some serious help."
its time for the TOs to realize that shitty stages need to fucking go. Players obviously already do.
Pichu looking sooo nice @gsmVoiD what are his problems/worst matchups?
on a plane with wifi but instead of charging per hour theyre charging me by MB... DO NOT SEND ME MEMES
Send me pichu/inkling/peach tech!
"(i will personally refuse to play him/appear in skits with him, outside of bracket obviously)"
"Sadly too many people will take his pathetic bait and vote him in, giving a platform to a toxic idiot. Please make sure to support good wholesome players instead :)"
people i want in ultimate summit  Glutonny Tweek NotSalem NotSalem  NotSalem NotSalem
i just wanna see into the spiderverse again tbfh
I will see you all in 37 minutes for my grand slam
man why did i order food when I wanna sleep
So many of these sets are decided by the edgeguards. It's a huuuge deal to have a MU where you can't be edgeguarded well.
Pichu üòÆ
Peach ü§î
Taking mad notes
Watch the first ultimate supermajor!! Top 8 starting now.
Good luck in top 8 wolf senpai :D
"Seriously tho, if we as a community do not leverage the fact that we have two great games that has massive crossover in player and viewership appeal we're stupid. Let's not repeat past mistakes."
"Melee breaking viewership with mango/m2k losing early, no armada and no leff. This game is eternal and the new hotness Ultimate giving us some help as well :) Smash community &lt;3"
I wish I could've played but it was intense watching this Melee top 8. Nothing gets me invested like Melee.
Long live melee
pika puff is legit 35-65  Axe is inspiring
The weirdest set It was hypeee
Melee &lt;3
ive decided to become the lamest fox vs puff player ever. @JWonggg im gonna need lessons
my heart :(
Melee pulling over 100k viewers duri ng the super bowl and everything - melee is as alive as ever.
Being a spacie is rough Being an amsa fan isnt
I don't like Hbox or Puff but seriously crowds need to be respectful. Get it together.
"I heard there were people selling the arduinos for training mode ultimate stuff, anyone still here?"
...sigh at this production value.
Come watch the best multiplayer game ever made
Its honestly embarassing how badly it was ran this time. Ultimate matches were hype but the tournament is not doing its job.
man genesis really cant schedule huh
Too lazy to get out of bed tbh
"like what, you think a guy this stupid would shut up even if he got My Bd? really?"
and no I will never money match salem. I'ts not about winning or losing. I don't think giving attention to the communitys literal shitstain would be a good idea.
this fucking idiot really doesnt know when to shut up does he
"misinformed üò¥ imagine being the 13th seed, lose to the 77th seed, and still complain about others brackets being easy someone tell seagull joe kofi wadi mkleo and yeti they're free LUL"
streaming  talking about my run in ultimate at genesis 6!
Gonna stream until my food arrives Sec
"Just think about it like this - people keep saying my charizard sucks, and maybe it does. But compare it to everyone elses 3rd best character (and that is a different archetype and really really bad) that they only get to play half a stock off and you'll see what I mean."
"If I my wolf/inkling etc isn't better than my PT in a month, maybe I'll reconsider, but honestly I doubt it. I know more than anyone about PT and their flaws and I've already given this a lot of thought. I'm not infallible but I trust my own read on the game over anyone elses."
"I know you don't mean anything bad but you need to realize - you're being extremely selfish. I am the one putting in thousands of hours to lose sets I feel I should win. I may have brought viewers and hype and thats great, but I don't get paid a dollar for 17th."
"I will keep PT as a secondary and play him on stream tho, but I've already decided to main someone else. If you think PT is good then great! Go play them. Please stop trying to make me to play a character I think is costing me sets."
This major confirmed two things for me I was almost sure of: I can be the best despite no smash 4 exp and living in a bad region (relatively). Cuz im pretty godlike. And pokemon trainer aint worth the effort. Bad characters will keep robbing me wins unless I ditch em!
"Also please don't shit on leo or yeti for their characters. They're doing the smart thing, I'm the idiot who picks characters that have to work 3x as hard. Patch or no patch MM shits on PT tbh"
Happy with how I did overall tho. Some bad decisions but all things considered I did great! Time to relax now.
I can't believe that was even close. Literally lost 100% to pellets and lead shield every stock because of matchup inexperience LMAO. Ggs to yeti!
"Next up is either yeti (megaman) or sonix (sonic) Never played either character before, but I believe I can still pull off another upaet."
"Damn that was rough, was actually winable tho with a bit more ike exp. Got hit by wayyy too many nairs at kill%. Leo played really well tho, props."
Up next vs Mkleo.
"Mkleo is looking ridiculously good, gonna be a fun match. First time playing vs ike, pls someone find me an ike to warm me up, im up front by the stream :="
Pretty good for a penguin huh
"Got MKLeo or Myran next, anyone good ikes wanna help me?"
LETS FUCKING GOOO
Any good robs who can help me practice?
salem LUL
good fucking shit @SSBMagi :)
"deleted tweet for obvious reasons. 100% autopiloted but its my bad. sorry, won't happen again."
armada losing to @Pandarianssb 's PT has me so conflicted  sad my boy lost happy a PT did well maybe i was wrong?? :o
damnn
congrats @shanksfgc !
melee players and fana do not worry for Genesis 7 i will be doing the seeding scheduling commentating and catering. Cleaning the  bathrooms will have to wait for whenever I have time over.
"after this major I will be spending much more time playing Melee, especially after Ultimate summit, so in the future I would be prioritizing melee over ultimate. Because of the circumstances however this is a rare exception. I am not leaving or betraying melee lol"
"Again, I'm not likely to make it super far or anything in ultimate, but I want to try! I'm rusty in Melee anyway and playing in that state while definitely possible is extremely stressful and requires a lot more warm up than it usually would. I hope you guys all understand."
"I think I could've made a better effort to talk to the TOs and figure out a way to schedule the events ahead of time, or at least know and plan accordingly. Honestly though I was just so caught up with the seeding that the actual schedule flew over my head. No one else noticed?"
I know I could've planned for this better and although I wish the schedule was better I realize that it's hard. If things were a little bit different I would've stayed in but I want to try my best in Ultimate since its the first major and likely my last one as a PT main.
"In the future I think I could pull of this horrible schedule tbh, but right now I haven't learned to switch between the games quickly enough to be constantly swapping inbetween the games. My physical state is also not really good enough to where I feel comfortable pushing it."
"It's really sad that they can't manage to run the only two big events important stage at least partly seperate, especially when there's several players likely to make t64 in both. I wish this was announced earlier so I could've at least planned ahead and not practiced melee."
"Sadly I will almost definitely be dropping out of Melee singles. Found out just now that the top 64s are literally being ran at the same time, even the TOs didn't know when I asked them... Yesterday when I looked t64 was ""unscheduled"". I was hoping for at least split up brackets."
Made top 64 winners at my first ultimate super major wooo
Playing against Kofi next who beat Tamim. On stream at some point. Any falco who can help me warmup? I'm by the stream warmup
Beat Seagull Joe 2-1. Won 2 stocks the games I won but it was hard af when he got the lead so it felt close! Gotta get used to how campy people play.
"Heading down now, am I on stream?"
Going to force myself up and do the best I can. Sorry if I disappoint.
Spent the last 16 hours or so in bed trying to rest up. Still feeling terrible but a little better. I don't think this is still a hangover lmao
Going to stay in melee for now at least tho. I may be rusty but if I feel better health wise tomorrow I could maybe make a run. GGs today.
Lmao I shouldnt have entered melee huh. Anyway made it to round 2 xd
made it xd
Omw down now
Stomach problems oof pls no dq from 6PM pools (got a bye)
Still got melee pools in an hour. Zzz
Made it out of pools in winners. Zero suit samus is weird. Gotta learn more matchups
never ever ever drinking at a major again
In so much pain rofl. One more set on stream to make it out of pools
Just gotta survive poolssss
Up on stream after 2 more sets
Stomach issues :(
man i am so fucking tired Hennessy needs a nerf
Check out this great video

"Ultimate bootcamp with Armada, android, rocky, maybe @gsmVoiD if he isnt a big boi flaker"
"Happy to still be here! 2 years is a long time in Esports, so let's make em the best yet."
Melee for me is still big boy rust but I'm still super sick beneath it. After Ult summit I'm going to grind melee harder and more efficiently than I ever have before. I don't think I'll do well at G6 but itll be fun practice either way!
"Fun day. Feeling a little bit more positive about PT and especially my play today was good but still getting a new main after genesis, even if I might keep PT around for the good matchups."
piranha plant gang guide coming up now

Charizard dash attack now kills at 160 by the edge instead of 180‚Ä∞ omg im so happy wow truly blessed #blessed
(note to self)
"The same people who say ""just play whoever you have the most fun with, thats more important than winning"" are the same ones that will scream ""WASHEDDDD"" and ""JOHNS!!"" when you get 4th at a tournament. Don't listen to those people, they just want character variety at your expense."
Playing PT at genesis since I need tournament exp but I'm going to start looking for a new main as soon as I'm out of the tournament. Will still keep PT as a secondary if the day the char gets buffed comes. Good night.
If I want to become the best fighting game player I need to kill my ego and obsession with difficult characters. The sooner the better. It's okay if I play the same shit as everyone else as long as I'm the best one.
"I was gonna tweet ""melee lied to you hard characters are not worth it"" but then I realized even in melee puff and peach win more than fox falco. Melee is always right huh"
so ill prob stick it out for now. Probably. Hopefully this is just a bad day and Ill think differently tomorrow but I doubt it.
considering not going PT for genesis tbh but I don't think my wolf is ready and I don't wanna go 0-2 LUL
"Just like with a21, if you have tech or tourney vods then please send them my way tho. My heart still wants to play a cool character and if others prove they can do it I can justify it. I sadly don't think anyone will be winning multiple majors with PT tho :("
"But yeah I'm just venting, hopefully I get proven wrong but I definitely didn't with a21. People (myself included) tend to overrate hard characters because when things go well its real pretty. Just gotta suck it up and pick a top tier ~_~"
I think PT might still be decent but charizard is just such actual horseshit and will only gonna keep getting worse - and I don't think the character is even gonna be fun if youre gonna play 20% squirtle and 80% ivy tbh.
"I aint the low tier hero youre looking for, not if im gonna take the game seriously at least."
"Did this for android 21 - people told me to play her cuz theyre selfish and want diversity, and told me ""buffs will surely come"". Not doing that again. Picking an easy ass top tier like everyone else and then I'll consider PT after theyve actually gotten significant buffs :)"
The fact that the balance team for ultimate saw both peach and charizard and decided neither deserved changes is why playing lower tiered chars in hopes for both is a waste of time LUL
Like 90% sure you can 2 frame inkling up b now woooo
If they looked at peach/inkling and thought they were fine maybe I need to play them lmao. Main reason I didnt was because I assumed theyd get nerfed.
Nooooooo
Also hit me up with the undocumented patch changesss
lets be honest its just because salem said he didnt suck Even sakurai knows salem doesnt know what the fuck hes talking about
imagine being so fucking stupid you think me saying snake sucko is the reason nintendo did fucking anything
No PT/charizard buff other than a suuuper minor dash attack makes me saaaad. At least they didn't remove swede swapping. Still most likely swapping to wolf or cloud (super nice limit down b buff) after genesis :(
Piranha plant with the boys @ArmadaUGS @UGS_Android  this character is soooo weird lmao
Patch is wayyy better than I expected. Probably the best patch ive seen from smash. More specific impressions coming soon.
New patch review with the penguin boys @ArmadaUGS &amp; @UGS_Android ! Bootcamp starts today!
If you are in norcal and want to grind melee/ultimate with me/armada/android hit me up fam no noobs :))
Patch day! I made a patch prediction video if you're wondering what to expect  (and we can laugh at how wrong/right it is in a few hours)
"(none of them actually mater, both were online FRIENDLIES, i just find the contrast hilarious)"
plup thread: my god easily the best melee player by fae BY FAR will get 3rd or 4th at G6 EZ  leff thread: uh well pokemon trainer is top tier and not many people know how to play against him and uh dont take online friendlies seriously i mean nairos lucina was playing off and uh
Lmao the difference in the reddit threads about me/plup vs nairo/mkleo is hilarious. Reddit bias &lt;33
"If you missed it then fear not, YT vids will be up soon"
GGs todayyyy  Was fun playing Nairo and Mango!  Hopefully I showed that I'm pretty fucking sick at ultimate... Sometimes lmao
Playing @C9Mang0 and @NairoMK POG
Live from the US! Bootcamp for Genesis starts today. Going to play some Ultimate with my fellow penguin @UGS_Android
Also make FD into a good omega version instead (can gentlemen to play on regular) because they have better visiblity and less distracting background.
Actually remove unova cuz of redudancy/shitty lighting/shitty walls No bans.
could do a 5 starter format and/or 0 bans as well. Main point is lets not play on shitty fucking stages in tournament when we have more than enough good ones.
The Leffen ruleset aka fuck shitty moving platforms and fuck slopes and fuck forced diversity:  Starters:   BF SV PS2  CPs  FD KALOS UNOVA YS  1 ban each.
Landed in the US woop
"Some would argue this would make PT too good Fuck those people. PT is the hardest and coolest top tier you can have in this game, people deserve to be rewarded for learning to play 3 chars with constant swaps as well as others play 1."
my patch notes for PT: make sq usmash faster and consistent Make dair or nair kill offstage at 100%s Nerf ivy uair make razor leaf do half damage but angleable make bullet seed consistent Buff literally everything but usmash for charizard this character is GARBAGE
"I think it should be largely randomized within tiers and avoiding regional conflicts outside of t32/maybe 48. Probably what theyve done now. Second, I hope the patch buffs PT so I can justify playing the hardest/coolest character :("
Two last things: I won't be able to check seeds cuz travel. I trust that its in good hands now with the added attention. 48 might be a bit high for me but I don't know if the people below me have actual results in this game.  144 for plup is too low most likely but no results.
But TLDR: I'm rusty af at melee but I'm gonna try my best to make a run. I'm not great yet but I'm gonna do my best to survive the weird matchups and to make an upset or two. More than anything just excited to kickstart my competitive drive and get this year started for real.
"Managing two games is difficult, but as I proved to myself last year with DBFZ, once you learn to seperate them it's definitely doable. It's hard in the beginning though since muscle memory really screws you over so this weekend will be a learning experience."
"That is not to say that this will be how the rest of the year continues to be, rather the opposite. After Ult Summit I will be grinding melee far more seriously than I ever have to finally get that #1. And I'm still entering this weekend, but I'm well aware that I could flop."
"People have been asking me which game I'm focusing on, and while I initially said Melee, honestly right now I'm more excited to compete in Ultimate since I have been playing so little melee with the heavy streaming schedule.  I don't think I'm great at Ult yet but I rly wanna be."
On my way to the US now! Going to be fun but also weird traveling and competing again. Honestly I'm just excited to grind offline fighting games for a week more than anything lmao.
"I'm happy top 32 of g6 seeding seems much improved. Other than that I think it doesn't matter too much, especially for people like me it's going to depend on matchups rather than pure playerskill I think. Still important to set the precedent to reward people who attend events tho"
"i think its really really sad that the last patch buffed his team so much relative to everyone else, i think he would still have been the favorite but you can't help but add the tiniest of mental asterisks to it when he was the only one whos team didnt get nerfed =/ arcsys fault"
kazunoko is inspiring man  leanest playstyle there is definitely the best dbfz player in the world.
7th best penguin practices Ultimate for genesis and watches dbfz finals
"Combined with such a strong player like Kazunoko he really has put his mark on the game. Its really does feel like the oki loop game now, not the defensive and patient game GO1 started it out with, or the scrambled offense Sonicfox responded with"
Gotenks/Gohan/Yamcha is utterly broken but its still (barely) beatable and at least this will be the last event its broken at...
GL @HookGangGod @SonicFox5000 today!
"So fuck you if you think I'm just doing this to ""cash in"" on the drama. Its not my fault the smash community keeps spewing such ignorant shit that it the best response is to laugh at it."
"I pretty much gain nothing back myself from all the things I speak up about and try to correct, it makes it harder for me to practice and be focused at events and it gets me a ton of hate online and irl by people who think I'm just complaining. But I do it because someone has to."
I have a massive target on my back at most events because I speak up about things that bother me and try to make the community a better place. Don't believe me? Imagine how many people are going to laugh at me if I place badly in Ultimate now.
Remember when everyone thought i was being a little bitch for wanting vip rooms and bo5?
"And if I see anyone else act as if I'm just trying to ""cash in"" on drama jfc get out of here. I've been vocal about seeding and community issues for many years and the only thing Ive gotten back for the progress is to be known as a complainer/bitch."
PracticalTAS doing a great job showing just how the seeders were allowed to become this toxic and terrible.
get it here
lffnEU out now Tshirt coming soon.
7th best penguin streaming ultimate then melee  before I break off a sheet of ice and ride it to Genesis
"Do you have any idea how hard it is to get a Switch to boot up when it's -135 degrees outside? Out here in Antarctica, we have a small but dedicated scene. I'm the only human among us, but we have some high level penguins as well. You mess with the waddle, you mess with all of us"
Made an album of a small part of all the shitty things the official g6 seeders said when I tried to help them seed.
in case you actually thought the TOs cared about results for @Genesis_Smash seeding.
Agreed.
"deleting the tweet because it was worded poorly. my main point is that I don't think this should be about us vs them, and that people heavily biased against a region should not be in official seeding groups for our communities biggest events."
"(i am obviously not saying it is literally racist, but fuck everyone who thinks that people that arent us are automatically worse)"
They now closed the chat and refuse to listen to me any more. I tried.
"Only 1 out of 10 people in the group said anything when I said that was mean. One said ""chill leffen"" when I called him an asshole for it. g6 seeders are legit extremely biased towards EU and have no problem showing it."
g6 seeders just compared EU top players to penguins JESUS FUCKIGN CHRIST
"Should seeding reward people who attend tournaments? (if theres doubt, should you favor the people who attend vs those who dont)"
another gem from the great g6 seeders
another gem from the great g6 seeders
me to the g6 seeders in their discord. Why am I seeded the same as plup/armada when I have the same or better results in melee 2018 and also top 8d at a major (or very big tournament) Official @Genesis_Smash Seeders response:
"Basically, all of 31 ranks difference because Mr.R didn't attend so gluttony couldn't beat him????????  Please RT if you care about fair competition and stopping heavy bias in seeding."
Another example of how RIDICULOUS the EU bias is: Zackray was 88th on PGR in 4 Gluttony was 70th in 4. Both won almost every tournament they entered (Zackray got 9th at one). Highest ranked EU/JP player on 4 PGR: 10 vs 9 Zackray seed at G6? #4 Gluttony? #35
"like honestly punishing europeans for what other ones did or didnt do in smash 4 is so stupid Like it's like punishing me and armada for how professor pro does in PM what. EU already has a massive disadvantage and can't travel often, and this is how you reward the people that go?"
THIS IS NOT SMASH 4. I REPEAT. THIS IS NOT FUCKING SMASH 4.
"someone took my ""eu sucks"" comments a bit to seriously jfc Imagine nitpicking a player that has won like 5 events of decent size Meanwhile captain zack (no offense) gets 49th and is still 6 spots higher"
"Genesis seeding updated - Gluttony still at #35, im still under several people who havent attended a single tournament. What the fuck. Am I the only top player who thinks going to tournaments and winning them should be rewarded??"
we made it
GL to all the goons at LCQ today!
Live with the Genesis grind!  Come in here if you wanna see how I prepare for tournaments :v
I may sound cocky but I really feel like I'm already improving quickly but with how complex PT is its holding me back from my true potential.
New patch is going to be interesting. I hope I can justify myself playing PT after the patch but I don't think so :(( Gotta pick good easy characters from now on like everyone else
Shit likes this just makes me want not want to go to tournaments. Top players should not have to do the brackets and play in them...  Definitely attending less tournaments until TOs prove that they can do their fucking job
"Along with the fucking Final of the DBFZ tour having no/shit seeding for 4 of the 8 finals spot, its a bad day to be a competitor lmao. I really wish TOs could just ask around before, so at least you can avoid shitty tournaments with bad seeding."
"The worst thing about the Genesis seeding isn't even that the 2nd biggest smash tournament will have awful brackets, but the precedent it tries to set tbh. Rewarding people for not going to tournaments and punishing people who do through seeding is so fucking bad for the scene."
MELEE PRACTICE
bro ultimate genesis seeding is SO BAD
"Just had this appear in game, leak confirmed legit! also streaming now huhe"
78th best Ultimate streamer grinds for ultimate! Going to be showing you guys how I prepare for a tournament today! Ultimate first then Melee
Leffen and being underseeded Name a more iconic duo
"Going to talk about the 2.0 patch in Ultimate, and the problems with patch culture - and making some predictions on what I think it'll change."
so happy i landed this in a match before they remove swede swapping =(
I DID IT IN A MATCH I TOLD YOU ALL I AM A FUCKING LEGEND SWEDE SWAPPING MASTER
And so my end as the best ultimate player comes to an end lmao Welcome @TweekSsb  Follow this man!
:D
alright lets fucking talk about this new patch one week before genesis 6.... streaming now...
run with the wind is so fire  time to sleeeeep
i am sadly awake again more genesis practice!
wolf is really fun possible main/secondary for sure
More ultimate!  Wolf is definitely at least my secondary at this point
gonna do some lowkey meleeeee
IM SORRY
Ultimate stream wee A little less sick so cam and shit today going to be trying some wolf and PT for Genesis then meleeeee
are there any reviews on playing fighting games on @ParsecTeam or similar cloud gaming services? I'm confused as to how it doesn't add a decent amount of input lag.
ive spent the last 16 hours in and out of trying to sleep this illness away but im happy to see the smash community actually believing the victim (for the most part... let's not talk about reddit) and happy @princesshyruIe is brave enough to come forward. faith in humanity +1
:v
"Playing melee + ult and living in sweden and streaming consistently is already like playing a bottom tier, I need that broken shit to compensate tbh. Pragmatic leff inc."
I'm so fucking stupid why do I keep making things so hard for myself for literally no benefit aaaaaaaaaa
Especially when I live in a terrible region for all 3 games I play (relative to jp/us etc)
Most likely characters to play rn are Cloud Wolf Peach. I need to end this obsession with playing hard characters if I want to be a multi game threat
The postitive side to this is ive been doing relatively well with a bad early meta character. One of the reasons why I'm even considering switching is because I think I could be the best (eventually) if I do.
"if the average character wasnt so shallow then PT would be wayyy better, but sadly so many good characters are also really basic..."
Not pulling an android 21 again lmao. If PT was worth it far more would be playing him since hes fun and creative. If he ends up being good great but if hes bad then you wasted all that time for nothing. Hopefully I'm proven wrong though.
"I'll still continue to play PT for genesis but unless PT gets buffed or most top tiers get nerfed in the piranha plant patch, he's going to be a secondary/for fun character from then on ;'("
Slowly and sadly realizing that pokemon trainer is top/high tier on paper but mid/low in reality.  No reason to play a character wayyy harder than any other when there's tons of easy top tiers to play. So much time investment to learn and PT might end up getting nerfed/being bad.
chillest streamer more ultimate practice maybe celeste/melee later
"average redditor: TOP PLAYERS NEED TO TRAVEL TO TOURNAMENTS ALL THE TIME, why do they care about the MONEY they should do it for the dream and the COMPETITIVE SPIRIT!!  me: so why don't you put in the work to get good then?  redditor: i would but i got a job/school  üòÖ"
And stop hating on people who focus on making a comfortable living....
So make sure to support @TweekSsb @NairoMK light (dont know his twitter) @Mkleosb and more! These guys definitely deserve sponsors and more reward for their hard work.
"About glitch payouts: This is sadly why you need to make sure you have a big brand/stream in addition to being a top players.  That said, its not easy for the TOs either, just a reminder to support players who give their all for pennies compared to what they could make on streams"
"New Video out, analysing Tweek and his win at glitch 6, and what exactly makes him better then everyone else right now, but also what he could work on!   If you enjoy this different kind of analyticsl content leme know :)"
"streaming now, very chill ultimate practice/maybe celeste"
still sick =( going to try to stream at some point but itll be REAL CHILL
Read the comMents on this thread if you want to be mad. Holy hell reddit is filled with absolute idiots.
"People who think that restreaming tournaments with permission is somehow ""stealing"" content are so fucking stupid its insane. Holy shit what."
Celeste was sick. Did a bside as my third chapter lmfao. Somehow found hyperdash chapter one and accidentally spike jumped LUL
"Playing Celeste for the first time! Really excited, heard a lot of good things"
Doing analysis on @TweekSsb 's win at Glitch 6 starting now! Going to be analyzing a few of his matches and figure out why he's probably the best ultimate player in the world.
tweek da bess chill recap stream soon
hyped for grands! I wanna see more of this Young link and how Nairo adapts might do a chill stream if people want after üëÄ
"Stage rulesets should be approached from ""why should this stage be legal, what does it add and is it worth the cost"" rather than ""why shouldn't X stage be legal? I need you to objectively prove that the stage shouldn't be legal""."
twitter/reddit/0-2s etc: OMG WE NEED TO LEGALIZE EVERY BORDERLINE LEGAL STAGE UNTIL IT IS PROVEN IN A COURT OF LAW THAT IT IS BROKEN  meanwhile 99% of top 8 sets are played on the PS2/smashville only - it's almost as if top players would play on good stages than shitty ones
wario is so absurd why the fuck does that character have a rest
just really happy nairo is edgeguarding :)
"he's great at showing people the pace the game is going to be played at, and how important good OOS options are. His only flaw offensively is imo that grabs are one of the best answers to parrying and his throws suck, and that he doesnt have great edgeguarding."
"i think fox is really good, top tier currently for sure, but I think he might fall to high tier when the meta changes (less swordies who he can abuse with parries/sharking) and people get better at edgeguarding him"
tweet about salem
She's a char that might become a real threat later on because of how much harder she is to master compared to the average ultimate char. If the top tiers get nerfed (likely) she will be in a great spot!
"Watching tanim rush these guys down is actually really fun.  My take on bayo still stands tho: Too much work for the reward for anyone who didn't play her in 4, and if you played her in 4 you probably picked her cuz she was top tier and shes definitely not top tier in ult."
My take is that he is just a mid tier with a ton of gimmicks and semi legit things that are weird to play against. When you play vs ppl ur better than who don't know the matchup he seems good.
"(snake doesnt literally suck, but he has wayyyyyy too many problems dealing with the fast pace of the game and straight up bad matchups to be anything above low high/mid)"
wow turns out week one results don't mean everything whaaaatttt noooo wayyyyy who couldve guessed
happy to see people edgeguard more and more and take matches because of it! told ya! ;)
"it doesnt matter if you're listening to bloody tears, death grips or a documentary about frogs, on youtube you're never more than two autoplays away from aruarian dance by nujabes. i mean it could be worse"
"Still feeling meh, going to try to stream some ultimate/watch glitch some tho"
"In case you missed it, uploaded a new yt video today, talking about The Summit and if me and the other non-smashers deserved our invite!"
"#NewProfilePic By Sleeksama (no twitter, made a few of my emotes :d)"
"Feeling a bit under the weather so might not stream today, at least not until later -_-"
Anywayssssssss  Good night.
Can we just fucking ban rebaz already? I know there was people trying to get it done last year but it seems to not have gone anywhere. Now is as good as time as any.
"Maybe I shouldve DMd him, but honestly after hearing countless accounts of rebaz stealing content and harassing people IRL and Online I am fucking done with half measures."
"Pengboys has been called out for stealing content how many times? Literally nothing changes. I dont care about my video specifically, im just fucking tired of having to do this and want to make it clear that Armada and others should not employ and enable parasites."
Honestly wouldve let it slide but him and smasha grey are literal parasites and rebaz has repeatedly harassed me verbally irl so nah. Its not my thing to decide but please get a better editor.
New video out of me playing vs Armada! Who's picked up Ultimate faster?
"Practice &amp; Chill with the Boys some offline ultimate, doing character requests today!"
"crazy 13 hour stream today, ty all so much =) vid of me vs armada coming up soon, im sleeping now tho!!"
playing @ArmadaUGS for the first time since release! tune in xd
"Stream is live! Going to be playing European top players today in Ultimate and later melee, as well as doing a lot of analysis of the best players of Ultimate today!"
disregard profile picture
"having a lot of fun streaming lately coming back to melee today was soooo nice more melee/ultimate grind with good players tomorrow, hmu if you wanna play!"
MELEE  time to get good for genesis new unclepunch?`
"Stream starting now!  Today we are playing ROB and see how broken he is, then derusting in Melee!"
"No evening stream for a bit today, will probably be on later."
Legit thinking he could be the best in the game or close. Insane potential.
Rob is actually fucking insane. Going to seriously try to learn him as a co main with PT.
bro rob is  ACTUALLY broken I play him now
Starting stream now! Going to talk some about The summit and the controversial invites ;)
"New video, analyzing the latest Japanese major to see how the meta is over there and how ridiculous zackrays wolf is!"
THREE SUMMITS ONE LEFF
last stream as an 8k man prob ITS BEEN FUN
"eating, talking, playing some ultimate, yknow, the usual"
"((play the game if you think youd like the story/music/visuals is my point, do not go in expecting good gameplay despite platinum developing it!))"
(you can consider the game a 10/10 but if you recommend it as a game with good gameplay then you are honestly stupid or dishonest).
also after my tweet last night i've realized theres 2 kind of nier automata fans: -people who like the game for what it is and want other people to enjoy it but they realize that how much you like a game is subjective and the game has a lot of flaws -people who are fucking idiots
"as someone who enjoyed homecoming, the new spiderman movie seems so shit with into the spiderverse fresh in my mind"
"All that said, it was still a fun experience playing Nier on stream. Talking to chat made the whole thing a lot better during the boring parts and the game has some really great stuff... Deep down, hidden in hour 30, top secret log 3, but still! ;) Next game is Celeste."
Going to watch the rest of the lore and other endings on youtube. Pretty excited since it can't crash on me or force me to kill harmless enemies over and over between every plot point.
"It is still a really interesting game, and I'm very hopeful that the next one will live up to its potential.  I just wish I'd watched it rather than played it tbh. Fastforwarding all the filler/boring parts (of which there are MANY) would've helped a lot."
"The story and the music are amazing by themselves, but since they are almost always presented through the combat or a 10fps cutscene it squanders all the potential it had."
"On paper this game is probably a fair bit better than I make it seem, but throughout the game I just had this constant feeling that most significant moments were ALMOST great. It feels like it would've been a far better product with a smaller scope, it needed far more budget."
I'd imagine it to be far better on PS4 Pro since I heard regular one lags.  If you do not mind spending 85% of the gametime in a bad to decent combat system with awful enemies then this game jumps from okay to great/amazing. That was not the case for me though.
Finished Nier (ending E). Played on PC with FAR mod. Definitely one of the most disappointing video game experiences I've ever had honestly.  Everyone had overhyped it to such an insane degree and the buggy mess of a game - for 60 fucking dollars - could not live up to it.  4/10
aight its fucking time to finish Nier route C once and for all
tier list tier list vid tomorrow
"Another day another Tier list video :o This one is ranking every character on how good they are at edgeguarding, as requested by @SkyWilliams . How good someone is at edgeguarding is a big deal when picking a main so check it out if you're undecided! RT :v"
Genesis Grind! Grinding some offline with @zaik_ssbm  Elite smash and such later :)
i am streaming live  edgeguarding tier list now! Ranking on both ledge trapping/offstage is getting ranked
"Streaming some Ultimate! Going to be a nice very positive non trash talking player and use Wolf and Pokemon trainer, as well as taking some requests from chat :o"
"Okay, actually doing the grand finals analysis now!  Shuton (Olimar sucks) vs Zackray (wolf uwu)"

i fucking cant believe that UVERWORLDDD keeps destroying OPs of good shows LMFAO
2 minutes into the first episode of The promised neverland and what the FUCK is this OP song
i have made a decision announcement time
Back live yet again! Going to grind a lot of Wolf and Pokemon trainer today... who I think I'm going to main. I think. Elite smash now then some offline smash later!
"Back for more Ultimate!  Going to try out my new mains, and potentially check out greninja?"
Doing a Pros/Cons video on stream to decide what to main in Ultimate!
just me and the boys you know
Going to make a Pro/Cons list on all my new potential mains/secondaries... time to decide for real x_x
If you rank the 3 pokemon from PT in your tier list but dont rank PT did you really pass grade school?
I don't mind not killing but man I want to edgeguard :(
... I kinda wanna play wolf too tho
Haircut time ahhh finally
"I think I've decided to pickup Cloud and Ike as serious mains, while still playing Pokemon trainer. Not sure who I will end up playing more but I need a basic char to teach me the game easier."
The sub bleed has officially started We peaked at 8878 before it begun. So close to 9k :( It's been a wild ride
oH SHIT  brb changing twitter bio
WHO DO I MAIN AHHH PART 2 Looking into Cloud/Richter/Peach more as well as playing plenty of Poke Trainer!
Nightmares are awful :(
Back for more Main soul searching Cloud and Pokemon trainer??? IKE?? PEACH?
I will keep entering tournaments every now and then and obviously practice the game when I can while streaming however! I don't want to fall too far behind if I do decide to give it a serious try.
"I think I will try to keep the stream as the focus for Ultimate and eventually transition into more of a competitor for it if the netcode gets fixed, and if I still like the game past the first few nerf patches and DLCs, and hope that people will stick around and support me!"
"Here is my long awaited 1 Month Ultimate tier list video!  Now with a different format to provide some more info, and a hell of a long run time going indepth on what I know about every character and what has changed since last time! RT :)"
"A lot of the time it's just dead serious grinding, for hours on end, with the only breaks for food, water and mental rest to ponder what you could be doing better. For weeks straight if not months. People who think that makes an entertaining stream are few and far between."
"Especially with how bad the online is, the practice you get while streaming even if you are only playing your main is actually extremely worthless to even a 1/10th of the same time played offline with no distractions and no stream to entertain."
"I feel like there is a lot of people who actually think that me, @zerowondering and other streamers have been ""seriously"" practicing the game just because we have been creating content for it. Maybe for some people that is what practice looks like, but it is not even close for me"
"I'm still not sure if I want to compete in Ultimate or focus on streaming/making content for it honestly. If I took it seriously my stream would be so different, not sure if people would still support it much tbh."
"I'm happy my message got across to most people in Europe at least, I'm sorry if I worded it harshly, it's not my intent to try to slight anyone.  I just want us all to be better."
The smashbros reddit saying that Twitter had caused too much unnecessary drama for the smash community is some funny shit lmao
Who do I main aahhh
"Streaming now!  Trying to find a new main, today will be Peach and Ike focused! Might also do analysis of Smash conference GFs if people want that ;)?"
if stating the fact that europe is far behind america and japan in terms of skill makes me the villain again then fucking go ahead. I'm not lying to you or myself about what the reality is. money match meif that's how you want it.
I'm going to try to host more EU focused online tournaments but sadly the online sucks. Once I get a bigger place this spring I will be constantly flying out other europeans and us players to practice with me (on my own dime) (if I still play ultimate lmao). We can do this.
and furthermore - YES I ALSO SUCK. I SHOULD BE BETTER.  This is not me trying to act as if I'm actually good and everyone else is bad. I'm always down to play and down to take criticism of my play. tell me how to improve my play in a constructive way and I will take it to heart.
"to clarify what I said about europe's ultimate scene: ya we suck dick. we really do suck compared to japan/usa and unless we get together, work harder and change things it will stay that way.  let's work on this shit together."
"Second part of the Tier list starting now (yes we are going mad in depth, the bad chars took 1hour+) TOP TIERS ARE NEXT WHO DA BESS"

lowkey might be a peach main if I feel poke trainer isn't worth it and I still wanna play Ultimate
If peach does a late nair on your shield she gets to grab before you can LMAO
Yikes
Is there any peach frame data for ult?
"Headed home now, going to make a tier list later today and analyze valhalla/smash conference as well!"
Salty 7th Place Drunk Stream
"Parrying 2nd hit of wario nair is actually mad good, i just couldnt bring it out in tournament. I'll continue to push the meta/PT at least casually, maybe seriously. Hope y'all enjoyed the games!"
"I should probably look into having a secondary tho, but not until I've learned to use Charizard and parrying better."
Pokemon trainer seems really good but also definitely not really worth it if you wanna win in early meta lmao. I think eventually they'll effectively become top tier tho but itll take a lot of time and practice. At least I hope so because most chars in this game are mad boring!
Anyway time to get drunk for the third day in a row
10k subgoal
Still not sure if I want to compete in Ultimate long term but I do kinda wanna get revenge on these smash 4 players ngl
"Pretty disappointed even tho I was a huge underdog tbh. Definitely felt like I could've won both sets if I just played more patiently and stuck to what worked. Oh well, 7th isn't too bad for my first smash tournament :)"
Match ups you aren't comfortable in are so fucking hard with PT. Felt like I learned the MU with Ivy by the end but I didn't learn properly at all with Squirtle/Char and he punished me really hard with walling aerials. Gotta try to find more peach practice soon!
"Blehhh, fucked up so much with squirtle/charizard. Good exp vs peach tho! GGs to meru"
"Playing a peach first in top 8, hmmmm how do I play against her?"
Also I'm kinda godlike for never having any serious Ultimate practice before thursday. See me with a week of practice LOL
Still mad that I threw so hard against gluttony lmao. I want the runbaaaack
"Won my losers match 3-0, qualified for losers top 8. Lets see if I can run it all the way back thru the gauntlet of matchups I probably won't know"
"Lmaoooo what a throw. GGs tho, fun games!"
"Up next vs Gluttony in Winners Quarters, shits gonna be rough. Lets see if my 1 month Pokemon trainer can stand a chance vs someone whos played wario for 10 years ;)"
Flare Blitz
On stream next for my second match ugh Zaik has my jersey :((
Leffen and Yabasta will be a little late for bracket. We blame 10 AM starting time and alcohol.
Nice time with the boyos I need more time off tbh
Lets get Dangerous
"Played pretty good today, could def make a run tomorrow if I make it there in time :vv"
Doing winner stays with Istudying and Gluttony now!
Streaming live now from Valhalla! Going to be playing @iStudying_ and others! If youre good at ultimate and wanna play come to the right end of the venue :)
"Stream will be live in a bit, gonna just eat and then I'll set up. Gonna play some with @iStudying Today!"
"Played the rest of my pool went well considering my physical state, only 2/3 stocks. I still get way too lazy and get hit by a lot of stuff I shouldn't. Gotta clean it up for bracket tomorrow!"
"Made it out of my Ultimate pool as 1st seed! Had a pretty close PT ditto set with Virum, man my charizard let me down lmao. Gotta take some notes from him :)"
DANGEROUS
Is there really any other way to play pools than without eating breakfast and a headache
Going to be 5-8 min late to my Pool pls do not dqerino @ValhallaSeries
Ultimate offline has been a ton of fun so far. Not too concerned with how I do tomorrow but making it out of pools would be nice. Hopefully I'm not too hungover/dangerous
"Not playing melee at Valhalla, sorry. Its a combination of being tired from 12hours a day for a month and not wanting to play PAL. Ill be back in Melee soon :)"
Back for more ultimate! playing with the BOys now @yungyabes @zaik_ssbm
"Live from !Valhalla ! Europe's first Ultimate Major ft. Leffen, Armada, iStudying Gluttony etc! Playing good players all day to try to improve :)"
"Headed to venue now, going to eat then stream!"
Also my hands look mad weird wtf dont do smash boys
I think my hair is telling me its time to get a fucking haircut
"Also we reached 8K subs today, maybe my highest peak ever before the bleed starts next wedk but oh man what a peak :) ty all, lets keep pushing!"
"Real talk if any character not named Chrom doesn't have good edgeguarding, the character probably isnt top or high tier imo. Too many kills on too many relevant characters are lost if your char cant do it tbh."
"Also I edgeguarded maaaaaad people today and I still suck, yall better be ready if you think ledge trapping is the go to :)"
"Thanks for watching today! Learned a lot of weird ass matchups and smash 4 tech, still got lots to go tho. Cya all tomorrow :)"
"if anyone going to valhalla has a headset/mic I can use for streaming (pref a logitech one :)) ) then pls let me know, willing to pay!"
Live from Valhalla day 1! Going to be streaming offline sets vs everyone all day!
my opinion on the g6 ruleset - fuck lylat and fuck castle seige.
"Going to be streaming from the valhalla venue in two hours ish, hopefully some top players wanna play me :)"
Told you @zaik_ssbm
"In melee/ultimate, can you pick a stage you yourself have banned?"
Back on the road
"PRE VALHALLA STREAM leaving in 2 hours, lets play ult and get 8k before then :D"
Looking forward to getting wrecked by everyone tomorrow and then try to pull of some nutty upsets if I can by Sunday :)
"Leaving for Valhalla tomorrow... Feels weird to leave for a tournament again lmao, I'll be streaming plenty from there tho! Early stream tomorrow as well."
any good EU players wanna play?
"grinding offline SMUSH with Jack aka ninja Leaving for valhalla tomorrow, lets git gud"
LAST STREAM before I leave for my first Ultimate major! gonna do a new tier list at 8k? and tons more
"My analysis from Let's Make Moves is live! Looked at a variety of sets, and looked a lot at some smash 4 players... Uh, interesting strategies, for edgeguarding/tech chasing!"
Happy New Nier - Route C time just going to do a chill definitely not hungover Nier stream
i think ima leave the drinking on stream to mango
Social Outcasts United new years stream! just playing some ultimate and maybe drinking a lil/alot
soon
new years eve will be streaming ultimate and nier like usual. Come drink and be lonely with me :)
I watched an entire tik tok compilation and I have now decided that growing old is a good thing
I have streamed so much my only friends left pay me through jeff bezos twitch prime service.
Its new years eve and i have no plans
Streamed over 15 hours today again... Thanks for watching all but  I really need to learn to cut it off at some point honestly. This isn't healthy in the slightest. Moderation is so hard for me :(
Back to smash after the Nier TORTURE  lets get ready for valhalla with @zaik_ssbm !
Finishing Nier Route now! Smash continues in a bit
ultimatenetcode.jpg
"Going live now! Going to analyze Midwest Mayhem GFs, analyze Lets Make Moves and fuck some people up with pokemon trainer :)"
Sorry. Gonna have to postpone the 2k sub tourney scheduled for tomorrow. Sorry but I don't think itd be ran well without more testing (spectating from eu might affect lag) and prep brackets etc. Will announce new date asap!!
also heres a glimpse into the future of parrying meta from someone that played yoshi in melee Small characters will fuck up single hit aerial users like swords (not chrom/roy) because of how predictable attacking them will be. Itll be like fighting against crouching jiggs.
I think MAYBE yoshi or peach are the only chars I can see winning over them RN. Obv could be wrong but I feel like as time goes on they might be significantly better than the rest just because of not needing another char to cover matchups.
Its the one matchup I feel like pokemon trainer is just like Regardless of which one I use they have no flaws I can abuse They edgeguard and uthrow uair zard so he wont live long Too fast+low dash for ivy  And squirtle just gets outranged and dies to roller at 70 Shit be hard
Compare them to the other top tiers and its like Chrom gets super gimped and loses a bunch cuz of that Peach cant catch up to fast zoners and struggle vs sword hitboxes Marth/lucina are even and solid but dont dominate chars  Inklings just like Sup
"on another topic, does any character actually have a good matchup vs Inkling? I feel like they are so incredibly strong at what they wanna do and yet still have basically 0 abusable weaknesses. Help me understand how to beat this char!"
this is code for someone please check this for poketrainer and palutena tyvm
Real talk why the fuck do all the frame data people never bother to check how - a move is on shield Esp aerials Its so fucking huge in this game and far more important than the exact knockback growth and rehit timer
i know this is the biggest 1st world problem ever but Why do you get 0 emote slots from 7000-9999 subs and then 10 at 10k shits wack :( or 10K the DREAM
does anybody have any Japanese vods for ult? I really wanna analyze the differences in the scenes!
"woke up mad early so I guess its time to get into the LAB going to explore some indepth mechanics in Ultimate, review japanese tier lists/vods and then play some Nier!"
parry meta is here tune in for more godlike pokemon trainer action rn
"Getting ready for my first big Ultimate tournament, playing that SWEET OFFLINE ULTIMATE with @zaik_ssbm n Jack! Pokemon trainer/Palu/Cloud??"
"Okay, live now! Going to lab a lot of tech today, review some japanese vods and tier lists? and finish route B of Nier today!"
"woke up at 8am like a regular ass human being wtf european time stream today I guess, starting in 30ish"
Got another youtube video up finally! This one is a 10 minute highlight/combo video of all things pokemon trainer aka the coolest character in ultimate
Still live with that sweet sweet offline ultimate! Doing tons of char requests as well &amp; trying out the valhalla ruleset!
"Playing offline ultimate for the first time in over a week!  Gonna practice some for Valhalla finally, and also doing character requests :)"
"starting stream! Today we grind some ultimate, do some mock Patch notes, and then I'll be finishing route B and start route C in Nier Automata!"
"At the end of it all, I just love competing. The feeling of improving after a rough loss, pulling a sick comeback, and the thrill of putting everything on the line - and winning, is something no amount of money can buy for me."
"Furthermore, I do not have a family to support and I live in a small, cheap apartment and I save almost all the money I make so its A LOT easier for me to make this decision than others. I am 100% not trying to throw shade at anyone else."
"Now to clarify, I have NOTHING against people that choose financial security and comfort over the insane pressure, anxiety and exhaustion that comes from traveling all around the world several times a month to have only a chance to acheive your dreams. It's not for everyone."
"However, I will be trying to stream much more consistently this year than last (which will be far easier since I won't have to go to both DBFZ+ smash events) and focus on keeping the YT content coming, and I might go to a few less tournaments as well, but yeah. Still a tryhard."
"I have never done this for the money, and as much as I really do enjoy streaming and the support has truly been AMAZING, I hope you guys understand that I just want to be the best more than I want to entertain people :)"
"People have been asking me, since my stream is blowing up, if I'm going to go to less tournaments in 2019 and focus on streaming.  I will keep focusing on becoming the best in Melee and possibly Ultimate if I choose to compete in it. I am a competitor first and a streamer 2nd -"
Nier Automata stream continues now! Completing Route A today and starting B
also I GOT 7K SUBS LESGO
merry christmas @LiquidSalem

"my career in dbfz is likely over with this and toeis fuckery and arcsys balance patching. It was a fun time, sadly filled with a lot of mediocre to terribly ran events (+summit) with ok to nonexistant seeding.  good times tho, met a lot of cool people during all of it. Pce!"
going to keep playing when I am less tired. thanks for watching oh and also the pc port is awful play on console if you have a choice
after the first 9 hours of nier automata here's my initial impressions: -incredibly letdown by the combat.  -the difficulty settings (normal/hard) are a fucking joke and ruin the combat further -love the graphics/aesthetic -10/10 music -story is good but hasnt gotten going yet
falco is top tier af wish larry would use nair and dthrow and learn uthrow uair confirms but still cool to see some of the potential he has
RIP the snake top tier era Week 1-Week 2 what a run WP GGS
snake SUCKO
"alright im gonna start my playthrough of Nier Automata now! really hyped to play this, heard really good things"
"Hmm, seems it‚Äôs almost time to reveal the truth about the two communities."
"Yeah, I‚Äôm a Pizza Expert. Along with that I know many things that most don‚Äôt know about these communities. Pineapple isn‚Äôt part of the actual Italian Pizza cuisine community and I‚Äôm not saying that because I don‚Äôt like them. I‚Äôm saying that based off of years of research."
"anyway, time to stream!  Going to talk about attack canceling, twitter meltdowns, pichu guide and more! tune in for this wholesome stream!!"
"let it be known that i didn't start shit. I just stated my opinion on a game I play. IDK if its jealousy over me doing well streaming it or whatever but I seriously hope this doesn't continue.  yet they still sit and say ""melee elitists"" cuz we think rage is a bad mechanics LMAO"
bro arguing for smash 4 players is as easy as winning tournaments with prepatch bayo

"Okay, doing the peach guide now! this is actually likely to be a future secondary/main for me so peep it if youre a melee player who wants someone cool fast n technical in Ultimate!"
"Going to go through the new tech Attack Canceling! This tech seems really useful for a lot of chars, lets lab it!"
Going to do a vote on what single player game to stream now! Get in here subbers
oh and I'm so fucking disappointed about DBFZ/Toei. It sure sucks that my entire career revolves around ancient japanese companies who desperately try to shit on the people that like their games the most.
my sleep schedule is a fucking joke but heres a stream  gonna play some Ultimate and maybe some single player game?
"Spending some time with the boys, no stream until later tonight!"
"yoshi is 100% the bardock of smash ultimate hahaha, more of him tomorrow! Also we fucking hit 6k subs :O going to do a single player stream as a celebration at some point, taking suggestions for games. Oh and we have this emote ready already"

"Starting the stream! Today we do a bunch of subgoals (New char guide, 5 worst things about ult &amp; more) and I'm going to try to actually git gud at this game. lets grind!"
Depends on what the game rewards. Of course this is true in brawl/smash 4 tho
"back with more ultimate! going to talk about zeros tier list, do another character guide, and some more pokemon trainer gameplay =)"

i am outside in sweden in december and i regret everything
"Great stream today, really enjoying pokemon trainer and palutena so much and man we broke 5k and we're already less than 800 subs away from 6k... Still expecting every day that everything is going to stop but it somehow never does. Cya all tomorrow and ty everyone :-:"

"AFOUND is pretty crazy value tho, not super interesting but still id recommend it!"

"Alright its time for ANOTHER tier list! ...this time, me and Jennie rank final smashes :v"
"The Chrom guide is now up on Youtube! It's pretty lengthy/indepth but I figured since Chrom is the best Sword character in Ultimate and a clear top tier, he deserved it."
won't you kindly consider watching my stream sir
"Starting stream soon, for the first time on my new username :D gonna be playing some online, do some funny tier lists/rankings, and more!"

"TIER LIST TIME Lets see what the week 1 meta looks like, and what the sudden patch changed!"
me after screaming and tweeting 50 times about no patch notes
nintendo are you FUCKING serious
BILLY BOUNCING AND SWEDE SWAPPING IS STILL IN FUCK YES
Please let me know if you find anything thats changed from the patch!
NEW PATCH IS OUT!  SHITTY PATCH NOTES AS USUAL TIME TO CHECK IF THEY FIXED LEFFLANDING AND SWEDESWAP
TIER LIST THURSDAY today we are going to play the best and the worst characters in the game and then sum everything up in an updated Week 1 tier list!
smashville is honestly a pretty fucking shitty stage when a game actually has edgeguarding
"New video up, this time I go through what stages should be played on in Ultimate!"
"Hey, stream will be a bit later today. Taking a few hours off since I've been streaming over 12 hours a day for a week straight. Expect there to be a 8 hour stream still tho :v starting in 4ish hours!"
get ready to be triggered ledge trump apologists.
Ultimate is extremely fun to play for me right now but theres three huge things keeping me from wanting to compete in it rn: 1. Online 2. Some chars having broken recoveries + ledge trumping 3. Nintendos patches.  Going to make a video on going in full detail tomorrow probably.
"I think chrom stomps some chars but also loses heavily to certain chars that can edgeguard him well and dont care about stage pos/getting juggled much. Think rob, mk, pichu/pika, sonic, squirtle"
I think chrom is one of the healthiest top tiers ultimate can have. I really hope he stays super strong and viable throughout the meta even tho I will very likely not use him at all.  Ultimates will be so boring if most of its top tiers have broken recoveries IMO
IF YOU FUCKING PATCH SWEDE SWAPPING SAKURAI I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN‚Ç¨
this is the best fucking ultimate clip there ever will be you bitches better fucking retweet
I FUCKING DID IT! THATS RIGHT!  I SKIPPED THE SWITCH TIMER I'M A LEGEND. I AM A FUCKING LEGEND

Who do I contact to have them make a gamecube adapter input display for my stream??
"New video out now! It's a guide on how to move in Ultimate, movement is a much bigger deal in this game and definitely something you will NEED to master to become good at this game. let me know what you think! RT :)"
"Starting stream now! Opening with a new vid, then going to play with the BOYS @yungyabes  @Volvagia77"

The only way we can make loud enough of a noise to have Nintendo fix their unbelievably shitty online is through meme-marketing.  RT to save an Online players sanity.
"Super Smash Bros Ultimate really is something special, man. In what other game can you have a 4 man match where Cloud, Joker, Mario and Sonic face off, with pokeballs and assist trophies going off left and right, despite those 4 players all searched for 1v1 no items.  Amazing."
"New Ultimate video!  I took a look at all the controller settings in Ultimate, trying to figure out why people have been complaining about lag  Also the buffer/HIGH SENS  breakdown is  100% required to know if you wanna be good at this game. RT!"

Back for more ultimate! Time to check out these pesky High Sens/Low sens rumors and try every controller out...
Heres my tier list video! Its from Day 1 so its basically a lot of speculation but I think some of my reasoning is legit ;)
Super smash bros ultimate has perhaps the worst online matchmaking/netcode of any AAA game - for its time - ever. I like the game a lot but that just makes this so much worse.
"ROAD TO ELITE SMASHER! lets grind online, im already learning a lot from the tutorial!!"
"another great stream, hit a new sub peak ( 1414! ) and had tons of fun playing ultimate also im sick at ultimate see me tomorrow"

"LAST DRAGONBALL STREAM EVER (uhh until the new patch) ultimate drops tomorrow, so gotta get ready for FDJ and shit now!"
dreamhack two time champ plays shitty dbfz patch talking dreamhack/fdj/smash ultimate come chill/rage
i would be upset but honestly im just happy i have to play of this shitty ass  patch
also FDJ finals is a single elim random seed tournament for 20k euros APODJOPASJDOP ROFL
I will be streaming a lot of ultimate starting as soon as its released in australia or whatever will be gone for saturday due to a dragonball tournament but other than that its gonna be a shitton of streams
i wish i had time to get good at tekken too
#NewProfilePic this hoodie is too long and i love it
"That trash talk out of the way tho, since europe keeps giving me free money ill be using some of it to send 2 european players to G6.  1 for ultimate and 1 for melee. If I can give someone my Dbfz flight to lcq ill give that one away as well. Gonna hold online tournaments for it"
Im fucking good at melee sometimes man. Ty europe for the ~$7000 this weekend. Stay free to my rusty ass secondaries lmao (except trif a little :&gt;)
Falco is a wild ride
ate nutella cream pankakes for breakfast so if my falco sucks you know who to blame
also im happy i won with a day 2 yamcha lol
Fuck gotenks
wow grand finals wow
awwooo
made it to winner finals with day two yamcha lululul
Won my melee pool by using the bird and won my dbfz pool by not having to play yamcha on point
Dbfz tournament today and smash pools iirc Never been less excited to play dbfz :(
Are there any change to ledge mechanics other being able to control your char when you get trumped in ult?
"Man honestly I never thought people still hated ledgehogging in 2018. I also really didnt think that ledge trumping/trapping was so well liked by many, personally ive always hated it but im gonna have to take a new look at in ultimate, idk maybe its better than I remember!"
"Anyway im done poking at smash 4 people who keep poking at some generalized image of ""meleetists"".   I'm hyped to play everyone in ultimate :)"
"To everyone who said ""who said its perfect???"" - no one said it, but many act like it, as if you dislike smash 4 or anything with it you need to be a melee elitist, you couldnt possibly just think it has problems."
"Real talk tho, if smash 4 is so perfect and great why are you guys so hype for all the changes in ultimate ü§î"
thinking either falco or marth for smash at dreamhack. hmmmm
cant really say I care too much since the seasons 100% over for me and its pal lol will be fun to just take it easy tho
leaving for dreamhack soon havent practiced melee at all and using a new team for dbfz lets see if anyone can prevent me from getting the money lol
dragon ball fighterz is now a kusoge without the fun
"last stream of dragonball ever ever ever until after dreamhack practicing for dreamhack, maybe learning gohan ;_;"
I said I was gonna pick up yamcha didnt I
Base vegeta works well with yamcha so prob just gonna play base veg gotenks yamcha Its 100% a bad version of the gohan team but oh well cba learning a new char when prob not gonna play this patch more after next week.
this is all making me appreciate melee so much more honestly it has its problems but it doesnt have patches with no warning that destroy the entire meta
thank god ultimate is coming soon. I really wish I didnt have to play dragonball in tournament anymore
wtf dragonball sucks now def gonna pce out until next patch where hopefully they will ACTUALLY fix dp assist and gotenks that time... as if arcsys would make a decent patch LUL
continuing my new team search... more dbfz
there is legit no team that can contend with gotenks/gohan/yamcha now lol. might as well just focus on Smash ultimate until next patch.
honestly id 100% drop dbfz on the spot if i didnt have 2 tournaments to go to in the next 2 weeks. i seriously wish I didnt have to play because the meta is going to be so fucking degenerate and I dont wanna learn a new team to play in this shit meta. arcsys why.
NEW DBFZ PATCH! All my teams are DEAD lets find a new one! (WITH 21???)
the entire reason i practiced dbfz at all was only so i could become the illest pokemon trainer alive for ultimate
is there any differences between simon and richter? the leff is looking forward to whipping some scrubs üëÄ
"no stream today most likely, taking it easy since Dragon ball is happening tomorrow anyway and I'll be streaming it a lot before dreamhack/FDJ and then its ultimate 24/7"
honestly first impressions of the patch - its pretty bad. not enough.
"bardock being nerfed is huge for 21 tbh, easily her best partner"
21 still trash gotenks uncontested best char now welp
leakers LMK LOL
can we get squad strike in melee easily the mode im the most hype for in ultimate hopefully you can do it online and maybe in doubles too??
I will be very happy if I can make a top tier team with two out of 21/hit/basevegeta! Hopefully they wont nerf 16 anchor too hard since all those 3 like him a lot
"honestly really excited for the patch!  altho it will likely destroy my current hit team and I have two tournaments in the next two weeks, i was never going to take them very seriously anyway, so its all good for me."
PLEASE BUFF 21PLEASE BUFF 21PLEASE BUFF 21PLEASE BUFF 21PLEASE BUFF 21PLEASE BUFF 21PLEASE BUFF 21PLEASE BUFF 21PLEASE BUFF 21PLEASE BUFF 21PLEASE BUFF 21PLEASE BUFF 21PLEASE BUFF 21PLEASE BUFF 21PLEASE BUFF 21PLEASE BUFF 21PLEASE BUFF 21PLEASE BUFF 21PLEASE BUFF 21PLEASE BUFF 21
Back from food with more dbfz! then playing/reviewing smash 4 in prep for ultimate :o
PLAY ME IN DRAGONBALL EUROPEAN PLAYERS PLEASE
"Streaming some dbfz, talking Japan saga, kazunoko too good! analysis??"
best tier list of all time
going to do a tier list on ultimate with @zaik_ssbm on what characters we are looking forward the most to playing wow haha very cool!
its been 2 years hello again smash 4 trying smash 4 again for ultimate practice with @zaik_ssbm  watch me rage
nothing fucking works jesus christtttttttttttttttttttttt
"my @elgatogaming HD60s is now suddenly not working (been a while since I used it but changed nothing with computer/capture card) and now it says ""needs 3.0 usb to work"" despite it being plugged into a usb 3.0... anyone got any exp with this?"
"super omega chill guy plays fighting games gonna start with some dbfz, then melee maybe smash 4 maybe skullgirls"
HELLO AGAIN - degen hit labbing first dbfz stream in a while :o
why is my internet not working ZZZZ
run with the wind is so goooood
2019*
Gonna try to move to a bigger place eventually as well so I can invite people over and level up together. It'll be a while tho but its one of my main goals in 2018.
At least one for melee and one for smash ultimate for genesis Im thinking.
Maybe some kind of tournament to send a eu player to Genesis to start? Will think more on it when I have time.
thought about this on my flight - i want to do more charity/fundraising events for 2019. Both traditional charity and thinking about funding eu players flights to majors etc. Our scene needs a boost. Hmmmmm.
"Going to make my best effort to not whine about melee anymore though. Summit was an awesome tournament and I don't want to keep bringing up negative things with ultimate coming up soon, even if its true.  Melee is going to be better than ever in 2019."
anyway time to fly back to sweden. i will come back stronger next season. Pce.
its actually insane how many people cant see this extremely obvious reason despite everyone constantly stating it. Jesus.
would you 1. Work a job you fucking love and earn slightly less money  or 2. Work a job that makes you miserable and directly harms your favorite game and scene for a bit more money? Winning is important but its not everything.
yeah leffen could go pro in dragon ball and win tournaments with roy but learning the easiest character in the game? No only hgod can perform such miracles
mfw people think i couldnt be good with jigglypuff when my pikachu marth falco and my fucking mewtwo beat top 30 players with little to no practice
man @htcesports paid for my all shopping and took me out to kbbq afterwards gonna buy htc till the day i die
(i didnt buy this one. but I did buy a few other things ü§ë) Vid soonish by HTC :)
What up
the sickest melee player in the world (:/) recaps summit! lets chill for a bit :)
All in all I played some fucking sick sets this year. Proud of myself. But I can and need to do better. You guys better be fucking ready.
Going to be mostly focusing on streaming and ultimate for a while. i wanna grow that side since I have some time now. Expect some new emotes and overlays n shit coming soon!
Its so nice to be able to relax now that the melee season is more or less over. Still got Dreamhack/FDJ master league but not going to take them very seriously tbh. I've earned a break!
In LA for another dayyyy Stream in 2 hours?
leffen forcefeeding zain [colorized] - 2018
My mafia rng is OD
Made like 8k lul What do I buy
"Summit is always such a great event man. Can't even be mad I lose for long. Had a great time the past 5 days, cant wait for the next ones!"
"I know I can beat Jigglypuff in 2019. Motivated af! Now time to drink and relax tho, pce out."
The best non puff player in the world is an aight title I guess LUL
"GGs everyone. Happy I tried my best, played much better than earlier today. Wasn't enough but I'm proud of myself for managing to do well in melee despite picking up DBFZ this year. Need to work on the puff/falco matchup a lot for next year tho haha :)"
"I just need to practice way more melee tbh. My playstyle is too demanding to half ass it like ive been. Oh well, reflections later, lets try to play better in losers."
"Inb4 ""but it was le hype""!!  it was. Just mad at myself for having a super inconsistent punish game and getting spotdodge shined a lot. I'll try to recover mentally from losers :("
Man I'm bad at that matchup now. Such a sloppy set
:(
Shoutouts to @ssbmARMY For the practice btw :)
What a set. GGs bananas!
Fuck this game
all the ICs coming out of hiding after Armada retires just like the villains did after All might retired
If anyone can netplay me tonight or tomorrow in socal region id super appreciate it. Haven't played much against ICS.
Beat SFAT 3-0 so I'm gonna be playing bananas tomorrow! Hyped I get to sleep now *-*
I know I can play so much better than this. Fuk me im bad sometimes tho
Choked big time. Gotta clean up my edgeguards if I want to win.
Beat Slox 3-0 pretty solidly. Felt like I allllmost lost the momentum last 2 games so happy I brought it back. Done for today :)
"Tbh think im just too overworked to have energy to practice teams and take doubles seriously, sorry if you actually wanted me and mang to tryhard. Another time."
gotta have at least one guy in the team who has a teams boner to make it thru doubles lmao I get time off tomorrow now tho so I'm happy.
I hope we lose to hbox bananas
Insert crush tweet about how teams is just all the bad parts of melee multiplied
10/10 set
"Think again - town was obviously doing badly, keeping a town leader alive when he is controlling town into playing badly is the right play for the mafia. It wouldve been easy for me to backpeddle. Had the game been going well for town u'd be correct."
"lol at everyone thinking it was ""obvious"" i was mafia who watched from the stream. I wasn't trying to fool you guys, of course its easy looking in -_-'"
mAaaan
2ez
My mewtwo/marth were hideous today lmao. GGs axe :) time for dbfz
I dont wanna play plup i dont wanna be slapped
playing slap city for the first time LUL what do I do
"Fun day 0, time to sleeeeep tho"
5 days of summit :0
this year has been so bleh for anime   for me. it's annoying to have to watch weekly the :(
enjoying Run with the wind way more than I thought I would.  Really solid so far.
LA TRAFFIC NOooooOo
if only i could win at least one forbes or esport award my life would be complete!! :((((( SO SAD OMG
"this is the best melee character. you may not like it, but this is what canc- I mean peak performance in melee looks like"
how jigglypuff players see her Vs how everyone else see her
alright doing the giveaway now!! get in here if you wanna win
HOTEL STREAM for a bit the mango winner omg giving away my special controller?
See y'all at The Mango 3
Does anyone have a stick/setuo and wanna play some dbfz LOL ya boi is off work now
Melee is always so much fun to play. Happy I played despite not feeling it. Time to chill now but excited to grind at the summit :)
My peak is ridiculous but I need to work on consistency still. GGs everyone
"Swedish played really solid though, hope I can rematch him in GFs!"
"Playing without headphones is blah, I get tilted too easily. Wish they had headphones with audio on the stage like in dbfz :("
Who can help me warm up fox dittoosss
#murica
"had food and lied down and now I feel awful now is it my sickness, the American food or both???"
I made top 8 winners wew
Peach players come find meee pls by the entrance
Any peach/ics who can help me warmup
(he didn't give me 5 bucks)
My phone broke   Gave leffen five bucks to tweet       ENJOY
Does anyone have Handwarmers? Venue is freezing
"Aight I'll play then. We'll see how it goes, not super motivated but the people have spoken!"
Fyi: gonna play relatively seriously If I stay in. No secondaries
okay so I looked at the mango bracket and I am the only one (outside of bananas in losers) who's in summit that's still in. Do I keep playing or let people duke it out for the summit spot?
"Oh ya I made it to winners, beat Tai  2-0. Second game was a lil shaky but eh that's what practice tournaments are for"
Who wants to eat
I just wanna play dbfz tbh
You should tweet about a VIP room - @MikeHazeGaming
In the mango venue and I don't see any alcohol and so no top players. What happened here?
Feeling a bit jetlagged/sick still but I'm gonna play my singles pool today and see tomorrow!
When does venue etc open today? Ya boi is jet lagged and bored
incineroar would be cool but slow dash speed now with run canceling and grabs being weak overall means he'll prob be boring af
"current ultimate interest list is: pkmn trainer, wolf, mewtwo, shulk, roy, bayo, inkling.  rest of the chars seem pretty boring to me tbhhh"
"if I wanted to tryhard to win id just play diddy, looks good and similar to how he was in brawl and smash 4 but MEEHHH i want something new"
What characters got major changes from Smash 4 to Ultimate? (or from Brawl-ult if they werent in s4) thinking about which chars i wanna try out and it feels like the majority of characters are either the same or nerfed. Only the mechanic changes seem big tbh.
anyone else at the norwalk double tree today?
landed in LA woo What's everyone doing today
PRE SUMMIT MELEE PRACTICE OOO
doing analysis of the dbfz tokyo exhibition now! looking at sonic vs go1 and sonic vs kaz!
"learning hit &amp; tokyo exhibition analysis! last stream at home for a while, melee later tonight (leaving for LA in 5 hours)"
Gonna be trying out the entire cast more or less to find a character I like. If I can find a sweet ass character then I think I can enjoy the game a lot even if I end up having some gripes with the game. lets hope :)
also if youre a smash 4 player... dont let me beat you at ultimate
im pretty hype to play ultimate a lot. not sure I like some of the new directions of the gameplay but im still super excited to discover a new game with everyone else and play people online. expect me to stream the game a shitton!
Summit !Grind! Labbing new fox ideas gotta get back to tip top shape
LEARNING HIT DAY 2  im sick =( so taking it easy today
LEARNING MORE HIT and then melee practice for summit!
LEARNING HIT
i know y'all would vote in a heartbeat if it was about banning wobbling or nerfing bardock so your lazy asses better get the fuck out there and vote.
"My balltop on my Stick keeps popping out, i have to keep spinning it back in. How do i fix it?"
Gonna try out Hit today :00
"gonna stream some dbfz trying out new team(s)  just lowkey n chill, talking a bit about this weekend and such"
Streams will sadly alslo be inconsistent as well for a while since I'm busy playing/traveling. Super appreciate those who stay subbed despite all this!
"Anyway, been getting mighty tilted by the internet once again so here's another attempt at scaling back anything that isn't super wholesome until after summit at least. Def noticing that I get way more easily irritated when I'm too busy so less social shit and more rest for me :)"
(if youre a smasher think of it as punishing a shield grab spammer xd) (used to mute but then other ppl responded to the idiots so it kept my notifcations terrible)
Blocking absolute toxic idiots on twitter feels strangely similar to hitting mashing green squares with meaty setups. Learn to play/behave bitch.
No use in complaining anymore. I think people with a top level understanding of melee already understand how marth counters fox and puff counters melee so ima try to shut up about it and focus on winning.
"Might have to pick up Puff in 2019 tho if the game keeps going in the current direction. I've decided that if a Puff is going to win anyway then it should be one that can JC grab :) hopefully it doesn't come to that tho, gonna exhaust every fox option I can think of first."
Motivated to grind melee again! Gonna make my fox better than ever. Got a bunch of ideas I want to implement.
"Heading back to Sweden now, ggs and nice meeting everyone!  lets keep improving :) @shanksfgc @ItsNoka Easyman!"
no comment :(
and just like that the melee euphoria is back
and the puff existential dread comes around once more
... lol
ill never get tired of watching fox falco
tuned in for the end of that =/
Base veg/bardock/16??
"Man the FDJ finals is 8th december, one day after smash ultimate comes out :/"
oh and im lowkey sick at dbfz again :)
Going back to sweden tomorrow... And then I fly to the mango 3 days later üòÇüòÇüòÜü§£üòêüôÅü§óüòß
"Pulled through! Won my FDJ pool beating Shanks, Easyman and Noka! Might not have looked that hard in game but irl it was extremely rough. Wew."
Hanging in there barely *--* two more sets
arrived at my hotel Gotta leave to play in 1 hour Slept 2 hours and feeling fucking awful xd
4 man pools with 1 making it out is the worst format. Almost always becomes a single elim match between the 2 top seeds Zzzz
anyway omw to france with 2hrs of sleep. Honestly can't care too much about the dbfz sets given things. Might play a gohan for the exp.
the fact that you let this go that far is the problem and why he keeps doing it -_-'
I want to clarify that I don't think wizzrobe is a bad guy or is even doing it with malicous intent. But excessive stalling is/should be against the rules and should be punished as such.
Just gonna start taking bathroom breaks midmatch whenever I lose a game because apparantly TOs need me to do their job for them like always
The fact that TOs STILL refuse to punish wizzrobes exessive stalling to the point where its clearly just straight cheating makes me so mad. Is it that fuking hard?
Gotta leave for my flight in 5 hrs big rip
Fun games gg My marth played sloppy and impatient but also hella clutch in GFs lmao
Winner finals xd Super rusty in pal marth fox so falco time?
I wanna go puff but that would delay things further so prob not
if it was ntsc then maybe id risk the burnout but playing pal fox vs pal sheik/fox is just bad practice anyway. switch to ntsc when also if anyone is on my case im like attending 8 events 8 weekends in a row fuck off
Shits getting mad delayed and im already super tired and my flight is tonight x---x I honestly want to drop out and sleep but id feel bad since im in winners top 8 so im gonna take it easy and play secondaries. sorry and Who do u wanna see
"Made top 8 winners, break before then but not sure if I feel up to play the rest, will see later. Also forgot my tsm jersey rofl i am out of itt"
headed to venue but feeling bleh and leaving for france tonight so not gonna push it if I don't feel well :v
might make it for tomorrow might not who knows and who cares its pal
rofl the boys did NOT realize that the club would be deep house x halloween x $35 dollar entry tonight gotta get drunk enough to enjoy this LOL @Volvagia77 @yungyabes
Someone please add naruto shippuden op 15 my dudes
Imagine thinking that this is a viable option Win or lose melee would die.
Playing jigglypuff and realizing how fuking broken this character is fills me with deep existential dread :(
Interesting exhibition! Gz @SonicFox5000
Lets gooooo @Zer0qIG good shit!
"this also applies to fox vs ics puff samus falco peach etc its a timeless, truly classiv tale of honest fundamentals vs cheesers"
"despite Rock Lee (fox) powering up and destroying his body (hands) in the process, he can't deal significant damage to Gaara (marth), even tho he is playing extremely bad. Then the marth gets one fucking CC grab from half across the stage and the honest fox just fucking dies"
Where were you when you realized that Rock Lee vs Gaara is just a trace over of an average Fox/Marth match. Rock Lee (fox) outplays Marth for the entire match with his taijutsu (tech skill) that he spent thousands of hours perfecting because he can't use any ninjutsu (cheese) -
alright direct overall i never gave that much of a shit about characters so meh  spirits looks like a japanese mobile game tho  def not for me adventure looks like classic mode + cutscenes maybe gonna be cool gotta unlock everyone - yikes for TOs online stuff - coool
watching smash direct and eating pizza lets see how this game is gonna be!
gonna stream the smash direct! starting a little before it (in 40 mins)
Adult gohan is very fun so far At least thats what Im telling myself Gotenks point is big sleep tho
uh streamed got delayed a lot but uh live now learning ADULT GOHAN
learning gohan on stream in 30ish mins  Tune in
"Its still a ""hard/high maintenance team"" but yeah just cant see myself enjoying bardock and if im gonna put in effort it should be with a team that fully rewards it. Kaz also proved u can play Gohan simply."
Landed in frankfurt and the initial lab results are in - gotenks/agohan/16 is the way. At least eventually. Send me tech!
I like hit too Maybe gonna steal sonics team lmao
leaning towards gotenks/gohan/16 right now but gonna mess around on my flight with a few different options. Maybe bardock :(
Playing technical high maintenance characters when tournaments are ran this badly is too stressful.
I already play fox so maybe I should just be realistic and pick easier chars for DBFZ.
"Hes 100% not bad tho, main problem imo is just that he has some awful point matchups and I don't want to have to switch team order around too much since that requires even more work and maintenance. If I only played DBFZ that wouldnt be a problem but yeah.."
"Probably gonna look to drop base vegeta eventually. I feel like Ive done what I wanted with him but I feel like the more I play I realize I don't like playing him, esp in tournament. i want more neutral and less reliance on hard combos tbh"
How does majin buu work with gotenks/16
My flight doesnt leave until 11PM anyone wanna play melee or dbfz? And what good food/shopping is there
Big sleeeep
If you can't walk in a straight line are you:
Hows the canada cup afterparty?
Canada cup still getting worse lmfaoo
HOTEL SESH with the goons @HookGangGod @TheSupernoon
"happy i did at least aight in dbfz tho, been taking some big boy Ls in that game for a while so i proved myself and some haters wrong at least"
Good shit @SonicFox5000 !!
"Man kept it competitive but overall I got bodied! GGs, still got a lot to learn."
"Fuuuck, close at times but sonic swept me. Small messups couldve changed a lot, gonna try to fix em for LF"
Waiting for a bit now Happy I made WF with a bottom tier!!
Ye im aight
"No setups to warm up, top 8 in 15 min"
Top 8 soon :v Hope they have headsets today xd
Lets get it istudying!
üò≠
Playing dogura tomorrow who has the steering wheel hookup
No headsets on stage is a fucking joke btw
"Made top 8 winners in DBFZ! Beat my practice partner @RudiVSF in a tight 2-1 match. I was shooook game one, good stuff."
Running a 3 day tournament with tons of setups and dbfz and melee both have less than 170 entrants - But theres just no way to not run both top 16 AND top 8 at the same time right? The technology just doesnt exist!
Cant fucking believe this shit
fuck this Rofl guess im dropping out of melee ggs everyone
lol melee top 8 is at the same time as dbfz top 8
at least I didnt go to twitchcon
Beat teemo 2-0 in sloppy matches Now waiting 8 hours for top 16 winners xd
Too many bad tournaments in a row has killed my spirit tbh. Waited 1+hr now to play my next dbfz match
So many bad tournaments this year. Sad because last canada cup was much better
I dont even care if I win anymore sigh
oldekdkalojfpdkfkdq#vahejjbddjjd  9am poooooools
"might have to drop out of smash tbh, i hate playing two games at the same time and I hate 9am into super late bracket too can my mind really stand both?"
got -15 in motivation for this tournament  got 9am dbfz pools and then playing both smash top 32 and dbfz top 16 at 7 until 9 fuck meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
no setups no seeding ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
Jesus christ
Is the canada cup venue open?
Someone let me know when the venue opens!
"Chilling at my hotel now (intercontinental), who wants to play smash/dbfz?"
"This all said, Im gonna keep playing and ill soon get to parts i havent seen played, so hopefully it gets better."
"""oh i remember this streamer dying here to a surprise OHKO move"" ok just gonna not do that. *gets to boss* man, thats pretty far, and hard with few estus, but I remember seeing that you can just run past enemies, oh wow now the boss is fucking free."
I feel like people assume I dislike DS1 cuz im dying a lot when in reality I'm upset that the game is too easy because I've seen someone play the same part once before and so that part its barely hard anymore. That wouldn't happen in many other games that I consider hard.
"The atmosphere and level design is great, but the hilariously shitty audio (switch only) along with all the bugs and inconsistent AI that youre forced to play around makes it feel very ""gamey"" and takes me out of it every time."
"Played a few hours of dark souls on my flight. Fun but very buggy and unfinished/wonky at times.. I'm pretty let down by the combat, its far more grindy and repetitive than I expected - feels like its far more based around trial and error rather than being deep and skillful. Meh."
on my way again
Last stream before canadaaaaaa! a bit of dbfz and ssbm before my flight :)
congratulations to everyone who made it into summit! make sure to use it properly and practice hard but dont overplay - a lot of people burn out before the tournament happens. and also ill probably be playing seriously at the mango no reason just wanna fuck ppl up
bbbbbbbbbbbbased vegeta dbfzzzzzz
melee !grind
MORE DRAGONBALLU
any EU jigglypuff players who can help this boy practice :))))?
oh...oh noooo
base vegeta is almost as good as beerus!! dbfz grinding for canada cup!
dont ban wobbling just fucking dont run top 64 before 12 or after 10 there.
"melee grinddddddddd no cam/mic for now, just grinding+tunes"
"I feel like I'm getting better and better everyday at DBFZ, just gotta do the same in melee now..."
If any strong DBFZ/SSBM players in EU want to grind today please let me know! hit me up here or in my stream chat
"Stream starting now! Its canada cup week, lets grind smash and DBFZ! starting with some DBFZ"
While mains of other characters*
"While mains of other mains have almost always tried to encourage and help other people to become better with their main, puffs best player has for years actively tried to prevent other puff players from improving."
"Melee prize money is low. Mango earns more from his stream per year than there is in the prize pool for all supermajors combined. People would likely support puff players less since they find her boring. Puff dittos would kill melee very quickly too, so long term its less $."
""" if puff is the best, then why aren't there more puffs????"" Let me spell it out for you.  She is not deemed to be fun by most melee players. Why play melee if you want to play slow, easy characters. ""but you can win money!"" She was considered to be worse for years, and -"
Jerryyyy
(banning ledgeplanking would help a lot for this lol. its incredibly broken done well).
also read disclaimer/watch the vod if you have questions. Puff is a half tier above everyone else for this one. i will do my best to make sure thats not the case for next years list.
"melee tier list for 2018. Fox/Marth are extremely close, depends on how common lower tiered chars are - right now theyre still pretty common, which hurts Marth. Throughout melee there is one general rule: Harder characters have better matchup spread/""peak play"". Puff breaks this."
Tier list time! lets do this
melee practice!! gonna do tier list in a bit as well
switching over to soul calibur! new waifu sub goal :o
"live with some morning dbfz grind! lets get this base vegeta ready for canada cup :o SCV after, then melee + tier list finish tonight!"
"doing a melee 2018 tier list! pretty indepth, starting now"
also regular watcher of my stream is even bigger + if you have your own good ideas etc it helps a lot since i dont have time to sit and think about emotes
portfolio or prior work experience is a big +
i need a stream guy/girl to make emotes/alerts and setup commands will be paid well hit me up.
first time playing melee for real since big house weee lets stream it and talk about whats been happening since ive been gone and oh tier list sub goal
EU dbfz/melee players hit me up if you wanna play today. Good players only. Sorry.
this is so fucking unfair. why was this not publicly announced or given to every top player?
"and before some smartass says "" JUST TURN THEM OFF OMG""  1. my controller literally cant turn it off for some reason 2. even then id be heavily nerfed compared to everyone else  and no im not changing my year long muscle memory of ledgedashing because the code is shitty currently"
this arduino thing is good for the community in the long run but its being so mismanaged that it seriously makes me want to quit competing at tournaments that have them. not sure about playing melee anymore at canada cup because theyre on and I cant practice for it.
"Is there seriously no way to get an arduino with the code here in europe?? Why is the code not available openly?? I know I've seen top players have their own arduino, how did they buy it??"
"Sure is awesome to have no way of practicing on a 1-1 copy of the game i play at tournaments! (no, i dont trust the dolphin code to emulate it perfectly)"
Guess its arduinos. Is it the same buggy version big house uses?
Is Canada cup UCF???
"tldr imo is: definitely not a great value for price if you are not looking to play a lot of ranked/multiplayer. buy if you're a fan of soul calibur or 3d fighting games!  If you're looking to get into soul calibur or 3d fgs, then its an okay starting point, but not a great one."
"-gameplay is fluid and looks good, moves have significant impact and supers look great. -few stages -i fucking hate ringouts -i still suck at it and have no 3d fg experience so I can't give too many detailed thoughts on the smaller changes. Reversal edge seems stupid af tho."
"Soul calibur first impressions: -good presentation for the most part (not kof14/sf5/mvci!) -story mode looks far better than most but probably not worth the purchase alone -still suffers from the fighting game developer syndrome, aka bad tutorials/matchmaking/netcode -few chars"
Trying out soul calibur! first time trying one since the 2nd one on gamecube lmao. first impressions/finding a main!
Dbfz online has been tilting me more and more It grows stronger after every offline session lol
starting with a lil morning dbfz then on to soul calibur!
Soul calibur stream soooon
Ty for playing me eu dbfz Better luck next time! üòÅ
"now 24 yo man improves at fighting games First dbfz, then smash, then soul calibur??"
Who is going to GTX and canada cup for smash??
"Even more importantly I have friends and family that support me throughout the highs and the lows of it all. I definitely couldn't do this alone and I don't thank you all enough. So thank you, and here's to an ever better next year. Let's do it!"
"I have a job that while extremely hard, high pressured, stressful and time consuming is something that at worst at least always fills me with purpose when I wake up and go to bed each night and its able to pay my bills and travel the world. For that I consider myself very lucky."
Its my birthday! I am now 24 yo. Going to be spending all of it on flights back from Singapore hehe. Its sucks but all things consider I can't complain too much.
Singapore dbfz with @NakkielPNW  hotel sesh for a bit
???
"Last day in singapore! What do I eat"""
Definitely just got done playing 100 straight dbfz matches with @dekillsage and oh look its 5am ooopps
I should just play gohan lmao  Dp assist is so stupid
"Playing much better today, crazy how much you can learn in one day!"
Todays agenda: Grind casuals Watch top 8 and steal everything Eat good food
oh and heres a link to the DBFZ EU discord if you havent joined it yet
like seriously. we can't do this alone. lets get good europe.
i have such a hard time for the european dbfz/smash scene because everyone is so fucking lazy. i'm always down to play and i'll give you great advice if you can take me being real with you and not sugarcoating.  stop fucking up and play me.
and if youre from europe and you actually wanna learn then wtf are you doing fucking play me im easily the best practice you can get and I stream 10 hours straight yet every top player is either just straight lazy or dodging me. come onnnnnnn
I don't want to move to the us because of obv reasons but i feel like im picking a bottom tier by not doing it :(( Just gonna have to bootcamp a ton more so I can at least play a low tier lmao
"Europe is just a bad place to live if you wanna be good at fighting games sadly. It's such an insane disadvantage the more I think about it. Weak scene, always jetlagged at majors, stuck with PAL for melee/PC for Dbfz. Sad :("
Idk how I managed to become top level in smash lol. I'd be twice as good if I had it easy and lived in a good region like 99% of all other top players.
I'm just realizing my main problem is how shit my practice is the more I play. No one makes me pay for my bad habits. I need to find more strong opponents to play when I'm home for both smash and dbfz. And how to make up for the huge disadvantage with training mode...
I fucking know I can do this. Eventually i'll get it together
Played mad casuals today and learned a lot. I still suck tho but I gotta accept it and keep at it and itll come soon... im impatient af tho.
"Anyway, i know itll make a shitty persons day but sometimes u just gotta block people."
Part of me wants to retweet every toxic manchild who kicks people who are down for sport and has never accomplished anything and show of how shitty they are.  but that would be letting them win. Still fucking incredible how shitty humans can be.
Anyway since I tweeted about being sad and salty for objectively shitty things happening to me the internet is going to be literal hell once again so im gonna pce again. Sure is awesome being a top player!!
This hotel is so ridiculous damnn
mostly cuz the food here is much better LUL
Dbfz has been taking me to new places and man its so awesome. Been traveling to the same few spots in NA for smash now for years so its really refreshing :)
Landed in singapore fiiiinallyyy
and yeah thats obv what im trying to do with base vegeta :)
"outside of bardock/16 being the best (which sucks, theyre terrible top tiers) I think the game is in a very interesting and potentially well balanced meta. I think a lot of chars need to find teams and synergy though, its up to players to find them!"
"to clarify, i think dbfz has a ton of playable characters and even bad characters can work well in a team of 2 top tiers that synergize well. i think the limit is for most when you run 2 low/bottom tiers (even if they have synergy) imo"
Arrived in Qatar (doha). Flight delayed by 3 hours =_=
Headed to singapore now! Just gonna focus on leveling up and enjoying some sight seeing since the event is randomly seeded lmao. Can't take it too seriously for my sanitys sake. Excited af to see singapore tho!
coolest supers tier list base vegetas command grab counts cuz its more cinematic than half the supers in the game
new tier list
doing my new DBFZ Tier list! find out how bad 21 is!!!! wow!! also ranking all supers right after lmao
im unseeded for @SEAsiaMajor for dbfz lmao playing kaimato (spelled kaimart? assuming its the same) round 2  pls fgc
all night stream before SEAM!! lets get this base vegeta ready
more degen streams in a bit my sleep schedule is so rip for singapore :(
lets get ready for singapore! DBFZ practice all night - base vegeta is back in.
woke up a little while ago (its 1am)  degen dbfz practice for SEAM soon
Sweden. Finally. Leaving for singapore the day after tomorrow tho Zzz
Landed in frankfurt Now 7hrs of labbing stronger
Also is Canada cup/summit/the mango/gtx going to use arduinos or ucf??
Can someone send me the code to practice with arduinos on dolphin?
Flight time. Prob won't be able to sleep so lets lab for 10 hours instead. Send me bvegeta / 16 / gotenks things!
anyway going to practice harder and smarter than ever in both dbfz and smash and live healthier and with as much discipline as I can muster. you're all gonna get fucked up in time. thats all.
"not sure how to fix this, probably just have to relearn ledgedashing completely on arduinos??? hopefully they can fix his and dashback out of crouch though..."
"theres a few other things but I thought i'd let people know about that one since a lot of people speculated about arduinos costing me the plup match. I don't know for sure, and since I have been rusty it could be me, but I did feel like I missed more ledgedashes than normally."
"not figuring out how the arduinos affected my execution more thoroughly was definitely a big mistake. My controller could not opt out for some reason (due to a bug??) and so I decided to focus on other things that I could actually affect, but looking back it was a huge mistake."
and for that sometimes I need to take breaks at weird times for my mental health and it also means I'd 100% go to a tournament I wanted to attend even if it'd risk my miom rank lmao. I do have some regrets for this tournament still but thats life.
"some people keep talking about ""oh but you lost #1 for 2018"" etc, but as i've said before, i've never cared about what a bunch of people think im ranked within an arbitrary timespan (given that melee doesnt have any actual seasons/breaks). I just want to be the best and win shit."
"in retrospect, tbh8 wasn't too bad for me, played some pretty good melee  -considering this week was the first time i actually practiced melee since evo- and I got a lot of motivation back to prevent me from getting complacent which caused the aforementioned gap to occur."
i love melee
can u guys believe my controller survived the slam unscathed just like melee it took a heavy blow tonight but itll be back soon
when is venue closing/does anyone have a setup if its closed?
is there any puff players who want to grind a bit more melee? won't be able to practice that MU in europe. hmu please.
i feel bad for armada im sorry adam
plup was probably up since 8am for his 10am match lost r1 to ics had to play GFs vs puff (set 1!) at 10PM great losers run but man it fucking sucks to see shitty schedules obviously affect players. hopefully itll be changed or ics/puff are gonna run this shit
congrats @HookGangGod !!
"The internet is going to be literal hell for a month or so now so ima peace for a while. Next tournament is SEAM for dbfz, see yall there."
"Actually not nearly as salty as I thought I'd be. Let it all out in that throw xd.  Tried so so hard despite being rusty execution wise and it just wasn't enough vs two great players. That's life/fox. My bad for thinking I could take that long of a break. Oh well, next time!"
ggs everyone Tried my best And Fuck that controller LMAOo
Got no one but myself to blame for that one tho. Still sucks but at least the crowd enjoyed it lmao.
Threw that so hard with my flubbs. Mango played on point but hard not to be salty when my execution failed me so hard. Oh well gotta clean it up for losers!
Mm lets do this
Does anyone have caffeine inside of tbh venue. Pls come backstage :))
"Pretty sure @theprinceofssbm has been paid off, this guy is GHOSTING me"
Falcos/puffs pls hmu if you wanna play :)
Pulled thru and made winners top 8! Im sick
"Done with the floaties, fox dittos are next"
How is there no samus mains in all of big house :(
PLEASEE setup 112
Any samuses who can help meee?
Ics players to setup 110 pleeeaaase
PLEASE
the roughest bracket requires the biggest of leffs
Any ICs who can help me warmup?
"Aight @TheBigHouseSSB / #TBH8  /whoever, this is your time to tell me if my match is starts at 10AM or if its on stream. Been burned so many times for coming on time only to be forced to wait on stream/late opponents."
pools starting at 8PM for only 2 matches and then top 64 at 10AM all the way to top 8 is some shit Big house please...
playing smart but really inconsistent execution wise Next time I gotta add some tech skill maintenance during my break mm. Still got this tho
"today was fun though, melee and its community is fucking awesome."
played meh today but its aight. Sleeping early kreygasm
Puff dittos üòê
Fox :(((
Fox :(
"""LEFFEN, TWEET THAT WE NEED VIP SETUPS! I can't warm up!!"" -@C9Mang0  Amen mango, amen."
won my pool Any dbfz casuals here since theres not really any for melee
Btw this is definitely one of the sickest fox edgeguards of all time
"PSA: dashback out of crouch is very obviously easier/different on arduinos despite it not being mentioned. Several other top players or literally anyone who tries it can confirm. Not sure if intentional or a bug, but sloppy either way."
Hopefully more setups open up/a proper vip room gets setup tomorrow..
Man tournaments that make it hard to play friendlies and practice are all B tier at best tbh
actually finding good tech with a21/gotenks/16.... noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo im back in
i think you tried this? @yohosiefgc
is there any way to use gotenks assist to combo with a21 outside of corner?
man @SonicFox5000 s beerus makes me want to try and make a21 work again :v
is there any friendlies/warmup setups/vip setups at big house? really hope its not like last year
"i know itll be hard but i want to perform well while also not going to far from this feeling. i feel like thats how ill do best in the long run, even if not in the short term.  lets have some fun."
"took a moment to reflect and i realized this is the least stressed and most fresh ive felt in a long time. not everything is going great but i feel so well rested that it just bounces off me. taking some time off after evo really did wonders for me mentally, 100% worth the rust."
Anyone got setups by the venue and  wants to get whooped leme know üëÄ
"Headed to venue! Feeling alright for this weekend, still got some rust left and got a tough bracket so we'll see, it'll be a fun challenge either way.  Let's get it!"
"Big House Bootcamp! Ft. Zain, Leffen, Wizzy, Armada, android &amp; Prince Abu back with more sick melee"
"Big House Bootcamp! Ft. Zain, Leffen, Wizzy, Armada, android &amp; more stream starting now! zain and leff friendlies inc"
aramda
"Big House Bootcamp! Ft. Armada, Leffen, Wizzy, Android, Prince Abu &amp; more more more more melee"
my pinky and bottom of the hand is still a bit numb - when i wake up its almost normal and then it gradually slowly gets worse.  I can still move it fine and my hand doesnt hurt it at all so idk what to do.
i feel terrible after every meal here in america
"Big House Bootcamp! Ft. Aramda, Leffen, Wizzy, Android, Prince Abu &amp; more starting now :o"
"big house bootcamp! ft armada, kjh, prince abu, android etc! now live :o"
reason im paranoid is because ive been awake for 4 hours now and numbness is a common symptom of carpal tunnel 0--0
Landed in detroit!  Woke up after sleeping on the plane with the lower part of my right hand partly numb... Hope its nothing serious/goes over soon :(
headed for the airport now really tired...
back with more DBFZ! last stream before I leave for the us tomorrow!
Does anyone have cooler frame data/hitboxes??
"crazy stream, long day tho! thanks @Bjergsen for the host :)"
cooler is top tier and so am I more dbfz
"arguably best player in the world practices (currently, not considering retired players as well) for big house MELEE time"
Ultra Instinct Ranked COOLER GOD vs zaik testing/playing some broken ass cooler
Someone find me optimal combos with Cooler/Gotenks/A16
Won with cooler! He is od
I have been allowed to play cooler wooo
I appreciate the initiative and the venue is actually sick but please learn more about TOing :(
Update: the one setup is shared between dbfz and sfv Yikes
Random seeding
man traveling to my first local for dbfz and apparantly theres one setup and cooler is banned Kskdlakdhsksk
ok nvm no break more COOLER then smash
android 21 is just BONELESS COOLER trying out my new main team ft cooler
Cooler is just a bigger better a21 lul
Initial thoughts 17 is mad average with kinda cheap but low damage rekka Prob low to mid tier point Cooler high to low top tier Mad ignorant
hit me with good fashion shops in LA Dont ask why
top melee/dbfz players of europe please play me online today and this week! im tryna get good pls lets practice
picked up new shoes today!!
so im the only player in the world with the ultra instinct rank on dbfz that means im the best rightt
Found new tech with b veg/gotenks/a16 and now I can do a ton more damage/TODs with a16 point ahhh nice
she sucks tho but im still holding on for some stupid reason Prob just gonna stick it out with gotenks
"A21/bveg/a16 might be the way, even tho its half assed af"
"I'm gonna have a really hard time in dbfz with smash starting, if I have to relearn everything, but I also don't want to play a bad team and nerf myself long term. trying to figure out a compromise but im coming up short"
Man I hope a17 somehow is broken af with a21 so I can play her
One meal in europe and holy overpriced blandness take me BACK
Few things annoy me as much as shitty flights
"yes every intercontinental flight but the ""all new a350"" thats equipped only with USB charging that I am on thus my inital tweet. (had to google to confirm since whoevers running the twitter account fell asleep mid sentence. Always nice to see ""innovation"" in action @Finnair"
My goal is still to be the best fighting game player of all time and that shit isn't going to happen overnight. I've made several attempts before but fuck it lets get it.
"Burnout and not taking care of yourself is so common in Esports, I want to both be proactive and set a good example."
"#1 focus when I come home is to focus more on my physical health and mental health, I want to improve sustainably so I can keep winning tournaments when I'm 50"
This flight is also so newly made the seatbelt on icon is colorized one step forward 2 steps back lmao
Why does @Finnair have 10 hour planerides with purchasable wifi with no electrical outlets... Smh and here I thought I could get some work done.
"translation: spent all my money on food and fashion, now I gotta go and win some more so I can continue smh"
"Last night in Japan, going to miss this place a lot, but I feel fully refreshed and I can't wait to get back to work!"
I feel bad for people in the west who play SFV
looked at clothes with color the entire trip just to spend 3k on black/white stuff only Oops
someone link me the roastss

#NewProfilePic
How is vegito w a16/gotenks?
"Headed back now, TGS is too hot and crowded for me üòÖ  Nice meeting everyone, I'll come back stronger soon!"
"Hardest part will be finding time to get good again with no scene and lots of smash tournaments coming up. In a really rough place dbfz wise, hopefully I find decent practice sometime..."
"My team feels like its really weak against teams with a beam assist, gonna have to rethink, maybe start gotenks against those teams? Or maybe say fuckit base vegeta is too hard and pickup bardock -_-"
"Lost round 2 lmao, and now im out, single elim baybeeee played extremely bad lmao, so pretty dissappointed, despite not expecting to do well..."
"Playing first on stream soon! Its single elim random seeding haha, lets see if I can pull something together :)"
"Playing 3 new characters is roughhh, but i will catch up!"
"I need so much more time with my new team, I suck rn :("
Heading to the TGS dbfz event now! Is the main TGS worth checking out? Its single elim so I might be done in 10 min heh
Going to TGS tomorrow to play in the single elim dbfz tournament because I am a workaholic
tried speed trainers on as a meme and now im caught in the comfiness
harajuku has too many places...
big boy spending day in harajuku/aoyama today ü§ë
Headed back now... Good games everyone! I lost and learned a lot!  Honestly now I don't wanna go home even more... I need to get better and its gonna be so much harder in Sweden :(
My team is slowly coming together... But its so hard to play and all the dropped combos hurt my soul. I believe ill get it eventually though!
Did i mention its free?
Maybe I need to move here :0
"I'm so happyyy... But also sad. This is what I compete with, but I sit at home and play laggy online matches vs noobs :("
"A ton of setups/sticks, food, drinks and tons of players from low to top level... Tokyo really is dragon ball heaven ü§§"
"Headed to akihabara esport square now, lets see if theres some good DBFZ players there :0"
Is it finally time for me to return to teams?
Are people playing DBFZ at Akihabara esport square today?
Melee mood
"anyways, gonna go eat some breakfast now, might stream later to explain my thoughts in more detail, stay tuned!"
"and who knows, as long as we keep Melee alive, there's obviously a real possiblity for Armada and everyone else who's currently inactive to come back at some point. I'll keep Melee interesting for as long as I can, and well, we all know how hard it is to quit this beautiful game."
"If you are afraid its going to hurt us though, and it might, now's your chance to step up - as a player, viewer, content creater or TO. Melee needs all of you, so get out there!"
To everyone who's acting all doom and gloom about Melee - please. I have no plans of stopping and tournaments have never been better to watch and enter than they are now. Netplay has been keeping people playing more than ever and with Ultimate coming out - we'll be more than fine
"Woke up to the news of @ArmadaUGS retiring Man, you've been one of my biggest motivators in smash (and so in life) for so long, sad to see it end here but I'm also happy I got to experience playing melee at the same time as you. Rest up, I got things from here :)"
"my team is going to be very strong I think when I get used to PS4 and learn to play it better! thanks for playing me everyone, ill try to come by to akihabara esport center on thursday!"
Single elim sucks but the event was amazing! Wish I could go to another one :)
"Ahhh ggs. Good shit Verdane! Broly is so scary, I need to practice that matchup!"
"My new team is strong but so hard to play and I suck still so its a struggle, but its a fun one!"
Headed out for fighting tuesday now!
fighting tuesday today! warmup DBFZ labbing

"It would be so nice if 21 didnt suck, I wouldnt have to drop my best char Unfortunately I think she ass, and I feel like everyone who put her that high just dont understand her well."
People who put 21 in S tier confuse the fuck outta me  Why Is there some sick 21 player I havent seen?
thats honestly how i feel rn. she is just so bad at playing the game it should be played. probably cost me several major wins by sticking with her &gt;_&gt; its time to move on and let someon else die for the cause
after thinking about 21 twice ive now realized she is actually so fucking bad she does nothing special and has bottom tier defense and oki either quitting her or dbfz lol

Legit considering quitting competing in America. I am just so sad and frustrated that people refuse to see the truth time and time again while the body count keeps increasing. Truly sad times.
*watches one melee set* ok jigglypuff is still broken  back to dota
i wanna go to ti in china dam
So hyped for TI finals today!! Lets go EG!
Are you fucking serious
WHO DO I PLAY dbfz character crisis part 3
"tbh I dont even think her neutral is close to the best, bad beam and bad jL / jH, mediocre ki blasts, average ground normals (now), awful jab, airborn 2H"
"literally everyone tries her and goes ""shes good just not for me""  ye playing a neutral based char with the worst oki in a game with superdash is not for you, big surprise :)"
I wonder where all the 21 players are now since she was already top tier and she got buffed and the other top tiers got nerfed! ü§î
is 21/majinbuu the wayyy? their synergy seems good and majin buu seems od in this patch whos a good third/is majinbuu top tier? @brkrdv @Alioune85 @MrKingFunk @iStudying
DBFZ - the team search continues! Base vegeta??
"this is EU PEAK TIME, fucking hilarious"
"ive legit gotten 2 fucking matches in 2 hours in dbfz, searching for anything above 1 bar, and those 2 were laggy af. legit gotta just quit if theres no online scene, cant learn a new team like this lol."
"Met a lot of friends and had a great time doing it, but damn I can't wait to go home and do nothing."
"last month I:  Traveled to and entered 4 majors+hyperx, in 5 different cities, in 4 different time zones, while also playing 8+ hours everyday I could.  results: 2nd, 1st, sick (DQ), 1st -250 twitch subs (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª  Im proud of myself tbh."
Almost home I get to degen and watch TI and shine this week Niceee

"Drinking 4 days straight and still winning the tournament is officially the leff now btw, did the same last year lmao"

"Fun tournament, ggs"

Falcons im by the front plsss help
Any falcons who can help a leff warm up?
Good shit @DaydeeTV
"Beat @Pricents off stream, playing s2j next in top 8 in a bit.  Hope I feel better by then ~_~"
Either this venue is an oven or im getting a fever or both
I am too tired

I sleep
thats the only thing that could motivate me enough to enter at all tbh Now to the club (3pm pools tmrw)
"Gonna enter singles in some form at Heir, but I'm treating it as a vacation first and tournament second. Not taking it very seriously cuz burnout/pal/drinking w friends but if I still win me and @GARMAKILMA will use the money to go to Japan for an actual vacation lmao"
Mixed emotions tonight. Life is quite the ride huh
Irl airport stream
Headed to Airport... Tired :( Irl stream with boys until flight leaves?
"In the end I have to support the EU scene, but shine is one of my absolute favorite majors so I'm still sad."
ugh spelling
"Going to attend Heir despite notg being 100% and maybe enter singles, skip Shine 2018 and attend DH montreal. Extremely hard call but I'm making it final now to put my mind at ease.  Thanks for your support."
HOME! Evo celebration... and leaving for heir tomorrow...  come chill for a bit
gonna have to see how I feel tmrw might have to cancel :(
woke up at home Jetlagged and sick Time to do laundry because I leave for Heir 8am tomorrow üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÉüòÉüòÜüòÜüò≠üò≠
Finally fucking home
gonna try to stream from russian business lounge trying out new dbfz patch/melee/etc on come keep me awake
might stream some ugly fugly dbfz/melee from the lounge in a bit so tired but i got nothing else to do...
"flight landed late so I missed my connection, now I have to spend 1 out of my 2 days home between Smashcon and Heir at a russian airport that forced me to buy a pass to the business lounge because no other outlets worked. fucking fantastic."
Bought plane wifi to complain about a 4 hour delay and no outlets and that 10MB of data is 5 dollars Pls do not reply to this message with meme pics it will drain my poor data Pls
Cya later America. Its been fun.
"I have missed my home so much, and being in the spotlight for so many weeks in a row takes a big toll on me. Can't wait to disconnect and enjoy the work I put with some peace of mind."
"On a more positive note, i played some of my best melee ever this trip and for that alone I am proud and happy. That I managed to break my EVO curse during it is just icing on top. A lot to remember and I'm going home satisfied."
thanks for sticking with me thru my ups n downs. im sorry. Ive got too much to learn still.
"Part of it is def just me being an impulsive idiot who needs a minute to gather my thoughts, and twitter enables that behavior. Going to test video/irl streaming in the future."
Gotta rethink social media and thru what medium I express my opinion yet again. Feels like I actually dont convey my thoughts properly thru twitter.
can't wait to go back to sweden and be a person again
fucking love degening in my hotel
Also deleting tweets to stop these hbox stans cya all next time I slip up
Fr tho gonna stop tweeting about u know who I dont take it back but i dont need to beat a dead horse
Armada with the clutchhh Feel bad for m2k but it was some damn good melee
Game 10
This is a tightass set
"Of course some people dont like puff, but this is not why he is disliked by the community.  Just look at his tweet earlier today... Its been 12 years and you still can't see this. Ridiculous."
gonna have to rethink doing fan interaction ... Gonna bring gloves lmao
after doing tons of signatures/selfies today while sick i realized - holy shit each controller/playerr is a germ-bomb. if even one person out of everyone is sick then its gg...
just woke up still feeling bleh whats up
i cant believe i just finished a large mcflurry i need to get back to sweden asap
so d1 got some sakurai award and hbox got to be the center of attention again but I FOUND A MCDONALDS WHOS ICECREAM MACHINE WORKED AT 1 FUCKING AM BOYS
whos the real winner here huh
i am truly heart broken that i didnt win a smashie im ordering a mcflurry
anyway my fevers hitting me so im gonna try to sleep again pce
i hope im wrong tho gonna keep trying to improve in the matchup as always but it looks so dark for most chars vs puff
oh yeah and in pal shes god tier only reason we didnt notice sooner is because the only good puff before is so much worse at fighting games then the other top players tbh.
destroys any char thats not out of the 4 she only slightly wins against with extremely basic play that works against everyone requires zero execution in the game that requires insanely high execution for the other chars in her tier. broken in doubles as well perfect char.
nah seriously tho without ucf and with these without a strong ledge grab limits  rule I think its very likely puff wins every single matchup in the game at least 55-45 on current human level i mean KAPPA fox beats her if u laser TWICE
puff beats fox  just like how DBFZ players beat melee players at melee @JerrySSBM
... man.
gonna order 50 dollars worth of food and cry in my hotel room
Not sure if sleeping badly/drinking after EVO got me sick or if its just the workload/traveling/bad luck. Either way I apologize to my sponsors and my fans for not doing my job taking care of myself. I will be better.
ill try to do a fanmeet of some sort tomorrow since ill be free if I feel good enough. stay tuned. thanks for all the well wishes and being understanding &lt;3
"officially not going to play at smashcon 2018. Seems like I'm only getting worse, despite plenty of water and medicine. Even if I'd struggled thru today theres no use if I will feel even worse tomorrow. Sorry to everyone. I will consider going to Shine instead to make up for it."
This is incredibly frustrating. Ive been playing great and I really want the chance to win another smashcon :(.
"Ok feeling terrible after food, going back to hotel. Pools in 2h 30. Very low chance I play but ill see if a nap helps. Sorry all."
Won my 1st round pool. On the very edge on playing R2... This is so stressful fuck me
Throats fkd up. Gonna try to play R1 pools...
"i felt okay for like 3 out of 24 hours, throat starting to hurt/light fever I think so I might have the flu or someshit. please let it go away by sleeeeeep."
"I will see how I feel tomorrow, I feel like theres a 50/50 chance that I will feel better or worse than I did today. It would really fucking suck to drop out, esp since the brackets wont be remade, but health comes first."
"headed for bed now, got 10am pools x_x If I don't feel better by tomorrow I think the right call is to drop out and rest since I have 2 more tournaments this month, but... both plup/wizzy dropped out, hbox has the easiest supermajor bracket possible..."
Really should not be allowed at this point.
oh and the arduino shield drops are wayyyyyyy better than UCF  Honestly arduinos have way too many problems and its not tested properly at all
Does anyone have an actual working arduino for sale/use?? Rumble if possible
just remembered i was sick and dropped out of last years smashcon... its a fucking curse.
"gonna try to head down to venue soon, sorry if im tired or grumpy, legit feeling awful but i need to practice if im gonna play tomorrow =("
slept a couple more hours and ate and drank tons of water and still feeling just as exhausted starting to believe im sick or something =/
"Not sure what to do to fix myself for tomorrow asap, if I sleep more ill have time getting up early enough for pools/bracket on sat/sunday. def drinking more water asap."
right now i feel as im really sick even tho im sure its just sleep deprivation. never felt this tired. ashamed of myself for taking care of my body so badly .____.
had the most elaborate nightmare  idk how my brain is such a good horror writer considerin i never watch horror movies another night without good sleep =(
anyway hit me up with that a21 tech for the new patch - how does she work with base vegeta/goku and can she do anything fancy by herself now?
"it is my curse to always be screwed by seeding tbh cant blame smashcon for it this time, esp since I was so late to look at it, but it def happens a crazy amount to me"
"Oh and im assuming smashcon seeding is final? @NintendudeSSB hadn't had a chance to look at it until now and I understand if its too late to change, but im curious as to why im seeded below armada tbh, unless it was locked in before evo (big disagree on that)"
in hindsight 4 majors back to back weekends + hyperx showdown was too much for me. need to take better care of myself once more.
"arrived at my hotel for smashcon i am tired. havent had a decent night of sleep since EVO, because i am stupid and celebrated too hard. honestly i just wanna sleep and lab dbfz but im gonna try to recover for tomorrow and somehow pull off another good run. this shit is rough x_x"
this dbfz patch legit seems amazing
hyperx showdown was super lit cant find my phone now tho =(
ultimate direct was great so much contenttt
I rly wanna que again -- yui
rOoFl
Infiltration is KILLIN uptown funk

21 on point - a bit nerfed Overall slight buff cuz of assist She worked best with cell tho so prob still not in any top tier team :/
Gimme 21changes

Got a highlight vid of a little tournament I won yesterday up on my youtube :)
"I also wanna eat some good ass food before I leave, whats u guys got (pref not unhealthy, no buffet)"
yo any good spots in vegas for fashion shopping yall would recommend
Fun afterparty The boys shouldve been here tho :(
Problem X!!!!!
Headed down to the afterparty Alexa play despacito
Sweden now has 3 EVOs USA has 3 Me and Armada carrying the entire european continent ;)
"Sideswitch is completely fine, there should def be a timer between gf sets tho"
I knew you'd win @SonicFox5000 !! Good fucking shit man
I LOVE DBFZzz
I still believe in Sonic
200k followers woo
"GO1 coming back so strong from losers, quick 3-0 reset!!"
Fenritti is so scary rn
Even shenron cant give u anything vs Sonicfox
Sonicfox is playing insanely good holy WAIT WHAT
Both of these guys are monsters
The CLASSIC  GO1 vs Sonicfox Right now
Watching dbfz and holy shit the arena is so much bigger with so many more ppl than I realized lmao
YOoo
:((
Gonna eat a big boi steal then catch DBFZ in the arena! Got a floor seat thanks to @ohitsjustliz_
"Right now the top top players get wayyyy more money wise than anyone else, in both sponsors and prize money, and I've always hated that so few can play full time because of this. Melee has given me so much so its only fair I give back."
"If they won't take it ill give it to a charity of their choice. A big part of my prize money with is going to taxes but I want to give a significant part of it to charity or back to the community in some ways. What can I say, Lebron inspired me."
"As I said before the event on my stream, I will personally be giving part of my prize money to the 5/7th place. 7th got around 130 dollars. The fact that I won does not change that the way FGC does prize split is not something i will ever agree with."
"I have a lot more to say, feeling all kind of things, but I'll save them for now and just enjoy the moment.  Thank you for all the support."
"Melee was always an outlet for everything negative in my life, and when I was no longer depressed or without a visa, I also lost a lot of fire.  The fact that I can be the best without being miserable means so god damn much to me. I really didn't think I could until recently."
"Since the beginning of the year I've struggled to balance my focus between friends, family, dbfz, streaming, melee and also somehow staying mentally healthy. The fact that I've managed to stay happy since my comeback in 2016 has actually been a big problem for me-"
"This win means so much for me personally. Not because of ""prestige"" or money, but because I had to overcome so many personal struggles to win. Evo has always been my worst tournament perfomance wise, but I finally managed to focus just doing my best for the task at hand."
I told you
Oh shit I made it to Bo5
Lets fucking gooo
Sleeping early. Massive headache. Worth it tho :) cya all tmrw!
US vs Japan for DBFZ is such a cool storyline
maybe up fireball is okay hahaha ;)
Damn @KnowKami !!! Reppin 21 so well lets goo
Good shit @TheSupernoon !!
any puff players who can play today/tomorrow??
"Again tho, really happy I got the chance to play dbfz one last time before the patch hits. Can't wait to play more soon :))"
"Lost right away in losers to Yuki (spelling?) :0 gl further to him, very solid play! Didn't feel like I had a losers run in me so im honestly relieved I finally get to eat and rest up for tomorrow!"
Proud of how I played tho - made a sick cell comeback game 2!
"Lost a really close game 3 set vs fenrich :( almost pulled off the upset Super tired, with a headache and havent eaten since 7am, but gonna burn whatevers left in losers"
Cmon armadaaaa
I barely made it in time for my dbfz r2 pool and somehow my rusty ass is now in top 48 winners :D
Fuck yes! Now to hope im not dq from. Dbfz
ONE MORE
8am pools with venue opening at 8am is just
Any falcon who can help me warmup? Got setups at mandalay
Not even surprised @levingy beat bladewise Man has been fiendinggg netplay more than any european lately and it paid off Gz!
"Won my dragon ball pool! WF was rough, lost first match but clutched it in game 3 vs Rion (jp hidden boss!?)  Feeling rusty but tbh just happy I got to play dbfz, i missed this game üòÉ"
PSA: Bottle of water is $6.50... And you need ID to pay with card Don't be dehydrated like me :(
"Swept melee pool. Dbfz next, haven't played in so long and I can't find a free setup"
"during this weekend ill be very busy, playing 2 games as well as I possibly can. so therefor i wont be active at twitter really, and probably won't have time to do fan signings/selfies until after im out - sorry!"
the atmosphere is thick all the people from all different communities def make evo unique i just wish i didnt have to go to bed already ill have to come back one day when ive retired
Practice has been good. Feeling good but anything can happen - just gonna do my absolute best and we'll see what that gets me :)
#putbackpuffinbrawl #resist
me when i beat every top player but lose in the brawl side event so i end up 4th
Autograph optional
If anyone wants a firefox notched controller with 95% dashback approved by big leff msg @hrcTypo
6am vanilla melee should be illegal
Good practice makes me feel so fulfilled Playing vanilla is a bitch tho
going to be nice to get to play pre patch one last time!
So my dragon ball pool got changed so I think I can barely play both if things run on time woo!! got a way worse seed tho and still won't have time to practice but its still better than not being able to play both!
"havent practiced dbfz in 2 weeks tho so idk if its worth, ill see how I feel on friday."
"I might still play my first round pool and hopeeee that they dont DQ me in round 2 while playing melee, and then try to play dbfz once im done with melee.  Not going to run back and forth."
"I'm sorry for all my dbfz fans, ill try to enter an event soon. The plan was always to try to play both but to focus on melee if the schedule didnt work out (did the opposite at ceo)! dbfz leff will be back, hopefully with an overbuffed 21 :)"
"I heard other people (@SonicFox5000 ) got swapped around to avoid this issue, thats why I still had some hope. welp. entering both games at the same tournament isn't really going to happen if the scheduling keeps being like this."
"So at EVO my DBFZ round 2 pool and Melee top 64-&gt;top 8 is played at the same time...  welp, guess I have no choice but  to drop out of DBFZ. it fucking sucks but what can you do, i can't play winners quarters vs m2k on no warmup =("
after many hours of research we have finally found the answer to puff
Pce texas. Thanks for all the support &lt;3
I'm just gonna try to do my best as a competitor this year. No use in caring about things I can't change..  Going to change my sleep schedule for my 8am brackets and act as if getting a bye in the middle of the bracket for both DBFZ and Melee is just someone getting DQd. lol.
"with Mr Wizards, erm, controversial personality, especially towards smashers, along with limited changes each year, I think it really contributes to me and many others feeling like EVO doesn't care about us despite what we give to them. It just sucks, idk what else to say."
"I may for example have my disagreements with @CEOJebailey (and i certainly am to blame for it getting blown up) but I never once have felt like what I say falls on deaf ears. It feels clear as day that both of us want the best possible event, but we disagree on how to do it."
"I'm sorry if this feels unconstructive and confrontational. I really don't mean it to be - I just don't know how we can change things when the schedule and brackets are released this late with no open channels asking for critisicm, while constant mistakes are repeated..."
"I don't know if its because its smashers ""complaining"" and thats why we're ignored, despite how much money we bring to EVO. Regardless, I really hope the rest of the FGC eventually starts realizing that we deserve that our biggest, most profitable event to be the best it can be"
"EVO consistently, year after year fails to meet the standard that other FGC/Smash events in many ways, most notably brackets/scheduling.  A part of me really wants to try to change things, but I've honestly given up at this point. It honestly feels it falls on deaf ears."
The swedes lost this battle. But we will be back.
Gotta learn the perfect amount of salt. Too little and you don't want it enough.  Too much and you won't last.
"Lmao sorry I couldnt help myself. Anyway pce out twitter, cya all at evo!"
the bad spelling is to make people realize that its just a joke! Hungrybox is lovely and puff dies instantly if your patient! Haha!
"Not trying to say I wanna quit or anything, but its obviously rough to  lose to someone who you feel  We will see what the future holds! I'm gonna go play some octopath traveler"
Good practice and an alright showing all in all. Not as upset as yall think hehe. I do hope one day that our community will see Jigglypuff-
"Ah, that sucks. Playing well consistently is so hard. One step at a time I guess."
Gotta play better.
theme
Any way we can get headsets with game audio for melee top 8? Alternatively just noise canceling with no game audio at least?
can never take wins for granted these days The matches where they never say anything when you win but its a big deal if you lose are so rough mentally Hope I can keep my consistency up :0
Army is that boi
"Made it to winners top 8 without dropping a game! My punishgame def carried me today, gotta clean it up for tomorrow!"
any spacies/falcon whos aight and wants to warmup :)?
uberdriver is circling me pls noo dq
me and my switch are best buds ive been playing  and its awesome
great chill first day
Fox vs falco gives me faith in melee
thank you this is just the I needed
"In the end, I think the best thing I can do is just not talk about"
"Seriously, if it wasn't for the fact that I'd probably quit"
Its honestly unbelievable that people think Hungrybox is
"every time I play vs, as, or watch jigglypuff i come closer and closer to the horrible realization that"
chilledddd all day headed down to the venue now
whatup texas
been traveling for almost 24 hours straight  I hope to dear god i wont be jetlagged tomorrow so I can actually practice
Almost at my hotel... finally
anyway my phone is actually dead soon Twitter will now be safe from my fury sorry but Fuck delta
what do you mean you need an outlet to charge your laptop just bring 5 fully charged laptops DUH typical fox players see its like when rich people dont want taxes!!
IVE READ ON AMAZON DESCRIPTION THAT A 50 DOLLAR POWERBANK BATTERY WILL CHARGE YOUR PHONE 15 TIMES SOO IT MUST BE TRUE
wElL LefFen WHY DONT YOU HAVE A POWERBANK THAT LASTS ALL OF YOUR 20 HOUR TRIP HAHEEAHAH BIG LEFF? MOre LiKe STUpId Leff!!
1% battery *gets on plane* no outlets well fuck you
Aight who can make me an arduino for smashcon has to be external

just please make her steals useful....
really happy theres a balance patch coming for DBFZ! but if they nerf 21 BOIIIIIiii
In case someone tagged in this convo is responsible for seeding - I can't understand how I can be seeded under mango. in any conventional way it shouldnt be a discussion. Please take a second look. That's honestly it.
Okay lets do this the right way - Can someone please let me know who I can talk to about Low tier City seeding?
european ssbm players please stop being lazy and play me through the netplays!
serious summer melee grinding lets win :)

HOLY Shit TIME FOR SOME VS FIGHTING PRACTICE... for other people helping the top europeans with some practice =(
Big mood
I just registered for Super Smash Con 2018   #SSC18 via @smashgg
low tier netplay practice for low tier city lets implement some new tech
fuck another goku/vegeta tbh
this heat is actually making me stupid
the chillest melee practice finding some new routines to practice for EVO and such
doing some MELEE LABBING/NETplay unclepunch mod etc
also european dbfz players play me on PC!!!
i have returned for more glorious online dbfz!! smash later tonight :)
"DBFZ leffen isn't dead or anything, but sadly he will be on the back burner since I have 4, possibly 5 smash majors in back to back weekends coming up. I'll still stream it and try to play whenever I can. Hopefully when I come back full time I'll come back to a balance patch :)"
"I'm officially dropping out of VS Fighting though - really sorry, i want to go but the timings really bad for me and theres no good flights =/ I feel bad for screwing up brackets, wouldn't have registered if I knew I was going to LTC but it closed in June so took the chance."
"on the train and headed home from the bootcamp at @ArmadaUGS s!  Was some great although slightly painful derusting, learned a lot and got a lot closer to where I wanna be. Still got lots more to do but I'm regaining some confidence, finally."
Some more melee
Live with more Melee bootcamp! Some serious melee practice with @ArmadaUGS @UGS_Android @DC_Pipsqueak
"i wouldnt trade the grind for anything though - i may be salty or sad, but im never bored"
playing bad after all the work i put in makes hurt so deeply its great on the good days but man the bad days suck DICK
(originally when I registered for VS fighting I wasn't going to LTC - traveling back and forth from the UK and then going to LTC after 1 day of being home would suck =( )
"day 2 of bootcamp RUSTY MELEE SUCKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS got really frustrated today, kept dying to bad plays &amp; stupid/unlucky shit. considering not going to VS fighting to get more rest/time to practice melee before the other events... will see once the bootcamp is fully over"
Bootcamp with @ArmadaUGS @DC_Pipsqueak @UGS_Android starting now!
do people actually believe that everyone who had bots on twitter bought them themselves lmfao
day 1 of bootcamp being rusty sucks playing rusty sucks twitch chat sucks melee rocks over and out
Fucking finally twitter
What hotel are people staying at for VSfighting? and what day are people arriving?
"Going to VSFighting next week as well, going to be mainly trying out my new Tien team and try to decide what direction I want to go with my team for the rest of the DBFZ tour. It'll be fun meeting all the europeans :)"
"Headed to @ArmadaUGS 's for a weekend bootcamp! Time to kickstart this summer of smash, gotta derust asap! Going to be interesting to see what I can apply from my DBFZ grinding to smash! also going to be awful to play vanilla again =("
i also just showered btw r/kappa on blast haha!
avid party game streamer back at it again!  Playing my favorite game super smash brothers melee on stream now for the 254th day in a row!! Today we are practicing my guessies and tech skilz with the unclepunch hackerino!

It's because I don't have the heart of Bob The Builder
ok going to stream some TIEN matches
Link me Tien tech pls!!
tien is SO GOOD
"nice try @shanksfgc ! Those goku overheads haha!  awesome to see my fellow EU PC players do well at Sonic Boom &amp; Viennality, hopefully the rest of the PS4 players realize thats where the real practice is at!"
CELL/TIEN IS A FUCKING PROBLEM AIGHT
short TIEN lab stream
"to expand on this - I feel like in the beta SOME chars/matchups had proper edgeguarding/kill options in the beta,  while others were exactly the same. Gives me hope that the rest will be aligned with those instead of the ones more similar to smash 4."
"edgeguarding, proper kill options, less focused on 50/50 airdodge reads, proper whiff punishing, unique viable characters, theyve fixed some of my problems with smash 4 but the core gameplay is still largely the same, im hopeful it can keep changing though."
gG
21/cell/tien is the truth?
Labbing new teams / reviewing others tier list / watching CEO? lets get it
there are some more _viable_ teams / chars in dbfz but come on Kid buu/cell are absurdly strong and they have so much more to optimize still compared to many other simpler chars.
"Made another video, going in details on my thoughts on Android 21, and how good she is. Full vid -&gt;"
trying out my new team aka the best team??
Long video explaining my thoughts on my new dbfz tier list!

"my new and updated tier list for DBFZ ranked on ""how close are you to be on a top tier team"" under the horizontal line is ""do not play if you wanna win"""
Making a new tier list for DBFZ live right now!
"Stream now live! Back with from CEO, searching for a new team. Doing new tier list mby?"
can 21 do it can she
happy sweden won but id be happier if the entire second half wasnt 1 lame rest into bair turtling  guess thats just soccer for ya but woo sweden!
also i might be a gotenks player now if I can get over how fucking annoying his VA is send me all the gotenks x cell/vegeta tech!!
Overall I definitely going to come back next year as long as CEO keeps trying to improve!
"However, I also understand that this was the first year in Daytona and that's always going to be a rough transition, &amp; while I'm personally not into wrestling, I really applaud CEO for doing its own thing and trying new things, and it really made the event feel fresh and exciting"
"Finally back in Sweden. CEO was a mixed bag, but with the good clearly outshining the bad for me! With my prev mentioned issues (real bad seeding/scheduling etc) and coupled with the fact that  Daytona was probably the worst area I've ever been to for a major really soured my exp"
My cell is going to be so fucking ridiculous holy schmoley
Labbed some on my flight and I think cell/kidbuu/21 might actually work :0 going to need a lot of labbing to make kid buu assist work with 21 and the reverse for kid buu but I can see it work out if I lab the fuck out of it. 21 dream still lives!
"I just thought about it, and if cell/kidbuu/tien is (imo) contender for best team in the game, then 21 cant be thaaaat much worse, esp since my 21 is ridiculous. Worst case I can just transition her out to Tien once ive become good with Kid Buu and theres still no patch."
i honestly just wish android 21s steals were better. outside of maybe ground teleport i think theyre not worth going for at all unless you can get one without sacrificing anything (rare).  def a big letdown
if im gonna cell out then im gonna do it right
Cell/gotenks/vegeta Cell/gohan/16 Cell/kidbuu/tien Cell/kidbuu/16 Cell/kidbuu/yamcha kid buu/cell/vegeta Cell/gotenks/tien hMMmm
"I do enjoy playing my team though, and it fits me pretty good altho my vegeta is very average. I think building around my Cell is what I'll look into first. Nothings for sure yet and it might take some time to find a team that fits me well. Interested in Gohan but idk the 3rd."
"I really don't mean anything bad by this but the more I see other 21s the more i get convinced her kit just isnt made for this game. Who gives a shit about neutral when superdash exists lmao. Hopefully someone will convince me otherwise, but I can't see her being top tier at all."
im pretty sad there was no balance patch announcement yesterday. Really torn about whether or not to switch my team or not. I feel like if I can find a better team I like it'd be irresponsible not to - if I have a chance to be the best I should I take it. It just sucks :(
yamcha assist is od Best assist free Good shit to Kazunoko tho! Best Kid Buu
went a lil hard yesterday im aight tho
Its litty
going to some smasher balance party thing let get schwasted
actually nvm Cba dealing with jims
Proud of my play this tournament though. Still sticking it out with 21 is working out okay so far so thats nice. Improvment is def happening in both melee and dbfz but I still need to get that big W! I'll keep trying my best no matter what.
"Out at 9th after losing to Dogura and GO1 :( Beat Fame96 and PL 2-0 very solidly, but vs dogura I kinda ran out of energy, I was playing too slow and stupid for a player of his caliber. It sucks, but I did decent for the bracket I was given. GGs!"
Fat Buu is so scary
man fgs are a fucking ride fun stuff
"Not too upset, every set vs GO1 has gotten closer and closer. It sucks bt it shows my improvement! Ty all for the support."
"Aw man, barely choked that set away :( GO1 played amazing though, amazing defense. A really fun set to play regardless of the result. Playing losers top 24 at 8, gonna try to recover before then!"
"Won my pools, wf was vs Rayray! Ggs, had to abuse superdash when I realized he wasnt playing around it, but damn his kid buu was scary!"
Up next on stream
I understand if some people think my melee fire is dying but it really is the opposite - extremely excited for the rest of the year!
honestly woke up today wanting to kick peoples asses in melee - but ill stick to my decision. i don't wanna flip flop and make it hard on the TOs and my brain knows how hard saturdays schedule would be even if my heart doesnt give a shit hehe. See me in some friendlies tho!
sucks for everyone who might miss CEO pools because of cancelled flights.. Maybe some melee player can take my spot :0? I feel bad for dqing now
florida fucking sucks
Worst restaurant experience possible ROFL
I wish I had caught the band yodeling in the middle of dont stop believings chorus
Having the best times @NakkielPNW
no ragrets
Jfc this coverband is murdering bom jovi
seems like I missed the last shuttle from MCO cuz my flight was delayed?? anyone down to uber lmao
"landing at MCO now, is there shuttles or if not how do you get to the venue lmao"
"On another note, are there any recent vods of other top a21 players from tournaments?"
See this is what is called overreacting.
gonna try to do a smash fanmeet at some point during the weekend so you smash goons who wanted to play can take a 4 stock or two and add my signature to your pokede- i mean controller as a consolation from me not entering melee ;)
"headed out to CEO now, hoping to have some good games this weekend and not suffocate in the heat. also hoping that people don't overreact at me prioritizing dbfz cuz of scheduling at a single event :)))))) either way ill see yall there"
For EVO i will instead focus on melee since its very close to other melee events. Thank you guys for understanding.
"I've decided to drop out of melee at CEO and focus on dragon ball because of the aformentioned scheduling. Sorry to all those who wanted to see me play melee, I did too - it basically came down to a coin toss.  Hope I can make a run worth it!"
"I told the TOs about this earlier btw, and I'll let them know which way I choose. Sucks that I ironically might  screw up seeding lol"
Haven't decided which one. Feeling pretty down about it since I've been practicing both. Shouldve checked the schedule before deciding to enter tbh.
"I really really want to enter both, and to keep doing it for FGC majors, but with this schedule I'll most likely fail at both. Sad but it might not be sustainable to enter both games at EVO either if the schedule is similar."
"Feeling pretty under the weather, leaving for CEO in 7 hours and its gonna be a long flight. My schedule is extremely rough for Saturday, with Melee top 24 at 2PM, DBFZ pool where I'd eventually play GO1 - starting- at 4PM and Melee top 8 at 5PM. Most likely dropping out of 1game"
both sides of me did well today  wp sweden and south korea ;)
melee with beat / watching&amp;talking FOOTBALL
a lil morning practice with @BeatSSBM
CEO practice with the @BeatSSBM boi prob whining about marth fox and ceo seeding inc
westworld season 2 was somehow better than the already great first season hard recommend
This is why you dont win YOU DONT HAVE THE HEART OF A CHAMPION ANTI
"I went through this whole shitty seeding thing already years back in smash, and after a lot of complaining and patience TOs learned. so since some fgc events (combo breaker had good seeding tbf) is a few years behind, i guess we gotta do this whole thing again."
"I paid 75 dollars venue fee for CEO and flights+hotel cost over a grand easy. Im lucky because I'm sponsored and usually at least seeded somewhere, but someone else might take their only vacation of the year, going to 1 major, only to get screwed by lazy seeding.That is not okay."
Hey or maybe you leave the playing to the players and learn to do your fucking job as a TO.
"Nothing pisses me off more than shitty TOing being excused because   ""you should be wanting to play and beat everyone, with no gamesound, best of one, laggy screens, caba screaming in your ear, on a overheated ps4, blind, deaf and in round 1 because im too lazy to seed"""
This is the dbfz CEO seeding atm  1. HookGangGod 2. SonicFox 3. Go1 4. Dogura 5. Fenritti 6. Kazunoko 7. ApologyMan 8. ChrisG 9. moke 10. dekillsage 11. Supernoon 12. Doza 13. Nakkiel 14. Leffen 15. Beyondtoxin (Cloud?) 16. Alioune  If you do not see how this is bad then idk
man who the hell did @CEOGaming  Dbfz seeding And is it still open to change
Swedish malls stock the dullest shit
going shopping without being able to find shit you like is not a vibe man
"Still feeling optimistic about staying with 21 for now, while she is hurt really bad by the vegeta nerf and not having synergy with the god tier kid buu, i think she has a way higher skillcap than most and played perfectly she can be scary as fuck even if shes technically worse."
"Late summer will be really smash focused, going to try extremely hard to finally get that W."
"Leaning towards focusing mostly on DBFZ for CEO, I'm trying really hard to implement everything I learned from summit and with how stacked it is it takes priority over smash for this time. Still entering melee tho, itll be a test to see if I can enter both at a supermajor."
watched the last minutes of the match don't personally care at all for national pride but i feel bad for those who do hehe Rough end Seems like germany deserved it tho But what do I know
how good is cell/bardock as 2nd/anchor vegeta might be out :o
yohji and undercover summer collections have me thirsty Gotta stream and win more tournaments to afford it üò° Not today tho Today i schleep
Prize pool is a bit underwhelming but either way I just hope this means more people will be able to compete and get sponsored in for dbfz
Super excited for the DBFZ world tour! Especially since itll feature some events outside of the US :D
whats the best airport/hotel for ceo?
Fun and long ass stream More throwbacks tomorrow \(-„ÖÇ-)/
Melee with the boysh
switching over to some DBFZ! lets show the summit level up o_o
back with more melee with the @BeatSSBM
the stream returns Just some chill melee and talk with the @BeatSSBM
"If you're good and from europe - same shit as last time, im the best here, come challenge me you dodgers ;)"
playing dbfz online now and the difference in my play and results since I came back from combobreaker and summit is insane. on the other hand its too easy now... feels like im playing melee in europe again :(
Things ran late and now i am omega tired Stream comeback will have to wait for tomorrow :( goodnight
def nerfing myself in the long run by sticking with 21 but I don't really have time to switch teams atm anyway so I'll most likely tough it out in hopes for a patch for a while at least
also ive been playing some more dbfz and implemented more things I learned from summit I think I'm regaining some confidence in my 21 team :0 could also be just playing bad ppl online tho lmao
been off twitter/twitch to recover from my 3+week trip Stream later tonight waddup
one of those eps for boku no hero :DD
back in sweden and awake after my hibernation finally back at my own computer desk feelsgoodman
"Going to make plenty of detailed videos/streams talking about smash ultimate after I get home. I got a ton of playtime that I spent purely trying new things out, since I didn't have to practice for the tournament, i think i have a deep and unique perspective of the E3 build."
13 hours of zamasu labbing btw
"Time to fly back to sweden! 13 hours until I'm finally back home. Great trip, altho I didn't win enough  I'm proud of the work I put in and I got to meet and spend time with some awesome people. I'll see you all next time :)"
I mean desu Desu
Hontoni vish is a subarashi commentator deska
Holy shit these are so nice By @VanimeSole
Was gonna try jump force and @lilyachty pulled up kicked me off the setup LOL
What parties are people going to tonight?
"That was fun, tried to test and show off the new dash mechanics and combo mechanics (like squirtle fthrow tech chase) Thank you @JCDotface and @NintendoAmerica for having me"
Going to be on Nintendo Treehouse in a little bit to talk about Smash Bros soon!  Tune in :)
"Headed to E3 now, got a few things on the agenda but ill have some free time so hmu if youre gonna be around :)"
Kill bill is lit
if three smash bros invites can't get into one twitch party is the party really lit
Can a smasher or two get into the twitch party @xD1x
rage bouncing fish too strong
Letsgo plup Abadango with the sacrifice
Aight melee players its time to triple team abadango
Aww
Bring it home for melee mango plssss
Rofllll
That mini doc was so nice Thank you @NintendoAmerica  I hope everyone interested in smash take that next step and try going to a smash fest or a local soon :)
"So far everyone at Nintendo has been very interested and responsive to feedback, so if you have any concerns then voice them!  The game is still far from final, and if they keep improving it I have very high hopes :)"
New link looks sick too After how much I loved botw i might have to play him too
"New zelda is a waifu I love the changes to pokemon trainer tho, future main maybe :o"
"Also, DBFZ for switch is so niceeee"
"Things such as dash canceling, omega battlefield, ridley and being punished for rolling too much really makes it feel like they listened to the community. If they keep doing that then there's few limits to how good the game can be!"
"Lots of interesting additions and changes in the new smash it seems like, can't wait for everyone to play it in December ;)"
All smash fans are about to have a great time with the new smash.  Gonna enter some tournaments with the meanest wolf
Kidbuu/cell/yamcha or kidbuu/zamasu/cell :0
"where is everyone at, just got to the hotel"
"Had a great time at the summit, learned a lot about dbfz and spent time with a sick group of people. Headed over to e3 now, excited for whats coming up :)"
I'm actually beyond excited to see everyone at e3 as well I fucking love my homies &lt;3
Special shoutouts to @HookGangGod . I believed in this man from the very start. Next fucking level.
I love the fgc/smash community We are all in this shit together
To be better**
Even if I haven't acheived what I want yet I am honestly happy to be living the life i am. I'm gonna keep tryin to better and I'm gonna keep being happy.
Summit was amazing yet again Happy to be a part of it :) Altho one of these times im fuckin winning!
Hookganggod.
hook is playing so NICE
"Next up is @HookGangGod With the crazy GO1 upset vs @fenritti, the yung blazblue god"
More commentary or let someone else?
"Gonna get off twitter and play some games, after this weekend its back to only shitty online practice :("
"For everyone asking about 21 - not going to make a definite decision right after a loss, but I'm definitely gonna try to explore other options."
"Still proud of myself for this weekend, I got washed by Reynald in pools just 2 days ago and now I felt like I could have won if only a few things went differently. thanks for everyones support, sorry I let you down :( Once im a bit less salty ill try to commentate some,"
"What an fucking awful way to go out. Felt like I was playing great and then threw 3 games I shouldve won, almost 4. Reynald is a beast and gl further but also i cant wait to play you again :)"
Future light yagami main
"man GO1 is ridiculous and that tod is so stupid :-: I played bad and stupid though, gotta do better in losers."
"knew I was gonna die night 2, no regrets in killing hook. Had a good suspicion about yipes, but had no idea about chrisg/sajam damn"
Being peer pressured to play mafia instead of practicing If I lose to GO1 blame the mafia
"Playing GO1 first tommorw haha, lets try to pull of another upset :)"
"Despite that though, the real test is tomorrow. Let's go!"
"I felt like I could very well lose to everyone here with how stacked it is  and I knew everyone was looking for a reason to discredit the smasher, esp since I was invited.  Really proud of myself for coming back after my loss to reynald and proving the haters wrong :)"
Fuck yeah somehow made it to winners!! Got revenge vs cloud from combo breaker in a stressful 3-2 set!
"Feels good to finally prove that im not trash at this game, but I gotta keep it going! Need one more match to make winners"
Lets fucking GOOO
Playing casuals vs @NakkielPNW over on
Where is everyone
Summit is mad fun as always Best tournament series free
pretty drunk for no reason still salty about mystery game
these goons can't fuckin hang with the mafia lord
"Had a rough draw for tomorrows match, playing Dogura, need to beat him and one more to start in winners. Damn its rough out here, i need to get betterrrr"
"i just wish I realized it earlier, stuck with her now, learning new chars is going to take time. gonna rely on that yung matchup inexperience :v"
"i hope all these people who claim a21 is top tier back their shit up and pick her i think she is mad overrated but id love nothing more than to be proven wrong shes not the reason why I lose tho, I need to get better but still"
"bustered out vs reynad, got a couple hits but couldnt keep momentum going :( Reynald told me i needed to drop 21 and pickup kid buu sad times"
"My buttons were off the first match rofl Oh well we won anyway, los leffos in WF of 3v3 yeeeee"
LeTsgoOOO
"honestly for me its not about the money, but with it everyone else is going to tier whore (well everyone already kinda does tbh) and I wanna stay competitive"
I really hope the dbfz circuit comes with a balance patch or its bye bye 21 after the patch :(
DBFZ tournament circuit announed  :0
Summit is so fucking nice Getting to practice with everyone is even more valuable for me in dbfz than smash since I so rarely get to do it The level up is gonna be real here
having no hard knockdown fucking SUCKs the way this meta is going
"everytime i play a good player in dbfz i realize another flaw in a21 :( i need someone to show me the way man, losing faith real fast"
Pretend this is a photo We out here
"man didnt enter wnf cuz I arrived late and wanted to leave early, tournament ended up starting late and im still here at 3am anyway couldve just have entered"
"Heading to WNF to chill with the goons and play some casuals, not entering but ill see yall there"
Rip cavs
last stream before summit! it starts tomorrow :o chill dbfz stream for a bit :) new emotes soon!
where are all the summit of power guys headed to today? anyone tryna play?
some chillass night time dbfz practice
"anyway, if you missed the stream and want to find out what my first impression of the game was, here's a clip of me launching it for the first time (well techinically second time, it just crashed right away the first time) WARNING: Seizuire inducing"
It's honestly just really sad how many of this generations fighting games have ended up being huge disappointments.
"To be clear though, if you enjoy BBTAG, great for you. I was really looking forward to the game but it's literally unplayable on pc and thats the main console I use, esp now since I'm traveling. If the game is still alive by the time I get back to sweden I might try it on ps4 lol"
rofl r/kappa thinks i refunded/quit BBTAG because I couldnt beat the a trial (which I didnt even attempt with buttons binded lol) ...yes that the trials are too hard for le party game player must be the only reason to dislike that game it is the only explanation
"more importantly, I do not like giving my money to developers that put out such shitty products, even if I could potentially enjoy the gameplay because I fucking love fighting games."
"the gameplay in BBTAG from what little ive tried and watched &amp; talked to other players eems to be the opposite of what I like, but I realize that its far more subjective, and thats why I won't shit on a game for it. the game not running on AMD tho? not so subjective."
"newsflash - most peoples first impression is through the tutorial the game crashed twice, into cutscenes did not work at all, shittiest UI ive ever seen, tons of bugs in an hour of playtime if the core gameplay is good then great for you, but im not eating shit to find out"
real talk: the fact that people buy and defend shitty fighting games/ports is a big reason why more people dont play fighting games. if you guys will pay 50-70 dollars for incomplete games that barely work then why would they change. demand better.
blaz blue cross tag battle is perhaps the worst game ive ever played
IS BLAZ BLUE CROSS TAG BATTLE BAD? first impressions / mini review / rants dont miss it
"will probably have to pick up kid buu after summit if I wanna keep competing seriously since no balance patch seems to be on the way, cant intentionally nerf myself if I wanna be the best"
kid buu is just a better 21  no reason to play 21 other than jump M and slightly more damage (but kid buu buffs your entire teams damage through supers so its not a big deal) wish I could play both but 21 does not work well with buu assist lol
the more i play dbfz the more i realized that the patch made this game WAYYYYY worse
summit zamasu practice / BBTAG?? gonna do some analysis of recent dbfz matches today as well!
"gonna stream some dbfz and try out BBTag for the first time today on stream - just woke up tho, gotta eat and stuff first"
ZAMASUUU - smash n splash champ/buster live from LA with that netplay&amp;summit grind
"Problem is that he needs assists for both combos and mixups, while also being much better with meter than without. i think hes a second since his assist is good."
what are peoples impressions of zamasu so far? I personally think he is a bit weak but a good team could get him to high tierish position
"gonna register soon, lets go smash/dbfZ :)"
Hello los angeles
Easily best summit poster damnn
flight time well needed time to disconnect from the internet shitters cya soon LA
"For now though, time to play some dragon ball. I'm not in as good of a position to win it all, but man I'm gonna give everything I can to make a run"
"Ive failed to perform at the very end of tournaments far too many times now, ive definitely been close to winning like every tournament ive entered since gtx last year... I know I can figure it out though. I did it before and I will do it again."
traveling after you lose suuuuuucks cant believe I lost 5 straight sets to that one boy. 4 of them game 5 i believe Ahhh man.
stayed up real late chillin  leaving for the airport in an hour or so lets do this all again next year Pce out smash n splash
Got a flight from Ohare tomorrow at 2PM Anyone going tomorrow morning who got room for a smol leff
I feel like im so close to winning every time Getting closer and closer Soon
before top 8 me and armada promised that whoever won between us would beat hbox I may have failed but fuck it im happy for adam
Thank fuking god
Guess I proved to myself that I can do well in both games at one tournament tho is well enough tho Evo tho
Also shoutouts to @Ninja  everyone who loves melee is a homie except one guy
"Did alright all things considered, tried some new stuff and some really worked and some really didnt. Fixed part of my mindset though, which has been a problem for a while. Still salty though for obv reasons haha. I'll come back much stronger, ggs and thanks to for the support &lt;3"
"Playing amazing into throws and awful plays into third place is the leffen :( Good luck to Armada, defeat that broken ass character"
I need a puff now aglet and @Vinodh_SSBM Suuuo
"That FD match was stressful, almost lost it. Oh and that last match speaks for itself"
American food has so much fucking grease on it  Keeps destroying my white clothes I think its telling me that smash needs its all black villain back
"hey, any puff/fox/marth/falco players who want to help me and armada warm up in our suite :)"
i am going to bed exhausted but satisfied but i expect to wake up hungry for more
"Big shoutouts to all my fans and supporters today, its weird but nice to not be the villain sometimes hehe.  im sad I couldnt spend time doing a fan meet :( next time!"
"Completely spent now, took all my energy just to barely win DBFZ, then ran on fumes and had to play 3 solid floaties, really proud of myself for making it through :) Top 8 winners is tomorrow at 7, cya all there!"
"Woo, I made it through my hell day somehow, the dbfz/melee double champ dream lives!! Good shit to Michael tho, really solid play!"
WHeRe did @theprinceofssbm Gooo HELP
"Woooo I did it!! Great games @LordKnightBB , holy shit im exhausted, somehow gotta power through and play melee now"
Up soon in Winner finals of DBFZ vs @LordKnightBB !
"Dbfz top 12 going on right now! Im up in a bit in winners semis, vs Shady"
Is dbfz starting on time @SmashNSplash
any samus/peach players who can help me warm up now or later :))?
Top 48 with little to no warmup/prep is gonna be rough but fuckit im sick I can do it
sir pls stop going for ledgedashes at 0 when ur missing them :( I feel that pain
Made it to top 48 after a sloppy set vs PRZ
"Got 10am pools, then break, then dbfz top 8 into top 48 with no break  .__."
"Good night, long day tomorrow"
anyone good wanna play some melee in my suite :v?
done for the day!  Finished round 1 pools in melee and in top 8 winners for DBFZ :)
No longer allowed to gentlemen zamasu :((((
"Hes really tricky tho, its going to take a LOT of work for him to be top tier level, and of course the biggest problem is why play a really hard char when you can just play an easy top tier :/"
"Tried playing zamasu a bunch vs @LordKnightBB , learned a lot but i didnt get much done lmao. First impressions is that his neutral is much better than I expected, esp flight"
"(just to be clear I voiced concerns about the seeding on monday, they absolutely had time to change it"
Hopefully they change both :)
if smash n splash doesnt fix dbfz seeding and I cant play zamasu im fortfeiting to focus on smash. Sorry but seeding this bad deserves no respect.
i feel sooOooo bad for lebron
Is there any way we can allow zamasu/vegito for @SmashNSplash  üò≠ I really wanna practice for summit both with and against them :(
ZAMASSUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU trying to see if I can use the god for summit !

"streaming some yung DBFZ some ranked, some Combo breaker talk, and going to review the zamasu showcase in 20 mins!"
Look how wack this looks rofl
"a spot where i got a bugbite yesterday is pretty swollen (not red, big bump tho :o)  should i be worried :O"
"One thing tho, I really hope more melee playersbcome out to more fgc events again. I really wanna go to @CEOGaming and compete in both games, hope people come out this year!"
"Gonna be grinding smash this week to get ready for smash n splash, then back to dbfz for summit right after. Let's see if I can make this work!"
Combo breaker was so nice had a blast hanging with everyone (im lazy but yall know who you are)  really inspired and motivated  i can do so much better
i think i need to invest in a crazy good support system to make it work analysts for both games is a next step for sure
i really really wanna keep competing in both dbfz and melee somehow ill make it work i hope
amazing tournament
Combo breaker DBFZ Grand finals @SonicFox5000 in winners  vs @GO13151 in losers Right now

"This game/community is mad nice tho, had a great time and its gonna be fun to watch all the matches today. But most of all im hyped af for zamasu :D"
"Learned a lot this tournament though, didn't expect to do too well going into it but after playing people here  I know I can do better than this :v gotta get a lot better to win it all though, hyped to grind it out for summit!!"
"God damnit, sloppy plays by me :(   Godlike mixups/combos tho @cloud805 , ggs! Out in 13th, rough times"

"No pools today, so just trying to grind some casuals and chill with everyone :)"

"practice practice practice practice trying to somehow prepare to be the best in two games starting with melee, dbfz analysis later!"
the chillest melee practice stream  Just tunes and melee tbh Ôæç(Ôø£‚ñΩÔø£*)Ôæâ
feeling tired af but gonna do a chill melee practice/goml talk stream soon
Part of this 100 mil is probably to make them the clear Battle royale esports game and shut out pubg etc out of the discussion. I wonder if theyll take it or swing back lmao Interesting times ahead üò§

Oof melee with @Volvagia77 it is hot outside come chill inside my stream!!!
gonna watch some go1 bardock and hopefully see some cool stuff. everyone so far just does autopilot shit over and over and over
i kinda dont my current team but I also really dont want to play bardock/goku (which is imo the other best 21 team) because bardock is so fucking boring
zamasu/vegito can not come soon enough. dbfz's character variety is so stale right now - playing vs bardock/buu/cell 99% of games is awful
"who do I vote for? DBFZ Summit voting watch! gonna play some DBFZ again and watch who gets in to summit, first deadline is in 1 hour!"

I can't believe I won Birdie! Omg! This requires a night of celebration
"Top 8 of King of Nordic is on now!  Ft. FA0, Jadde, Pipsqueak, myself and more!"
My editor cut out me laughing Now the people will never know me as the lovable dork i am
Birdie boys @Volvagia77 got last place in his pool so he did not deserve to be in
"Live now with King of Nordic!  melee tournament with Leffen, Beat, pipsqueak and more! Big pot, commentary by me, and retro overlay, what more could you possibly want?"
Sunny sweden is so top tier
"survivors mentality is definitely a real thing, not everyone who is great at something can make a living doing it, and i think a lot of people who do make it forget how lucky they were   but no, being stuck in bronze is not your teammates fault LOL"
"i feel like its important to highlight that far from everyone who dedicate themselves and pursue perfection ever make it/become famous doing it but there is still value in it  take me, im just some guy who tried really hard to be good at smash and then it happened to blow up"
its a blessing and a curse for sure
"i truly feel like a big reason why the avg human don't generally excel at the things they spend their time on, is because they are able to appreciate unrefined/bad versions of that thing, so there's nothing really pushing them to spend hours and hours of practice perfecting it"
"for the longest time i just assumed that there was something wrong with me or that disliking most things of x subject ment that I didn't like that thing alltogether nowadays its an aspect of myself that i really appreciate, its the core of what makes me want to improve at things"
"i dislike and am very critical of most things but its because that rare time when i find what i fuck with, that makes it all worth and then some  its a feeling that makes me so happy and satisfied yet inspired at the same time  yeah"
Popcorn technically allowed while partaking in my life story but frowned upon

This is a little late but I am officially invited by @NintendoAmerica as an alternate to the Smash Bros. Invitational! Excited to try the new game and hang out with everyone else that's invited :)
"its always hilarious to me when people act as if you critique something then you are an inherently sad person who is only disliking things to be a contrarian. theres more than one way to enjoy ""art"" dipshits"
if you aren't enjoying my thoughts then nobody is forcing you to follow me. just let people live.
i just watched ep 16 and WTF WAIFU BAIT CAN JUST SHAVE THE HORNS? WHAT LOL also they dont even mention the casual all generic cgi monsters are humans and GIANT HAND-KUN because FISH also hello im 002 my entire character development is done i am now cardboard
if you still think this show is good you literally have shit taste its actually becoming too bad to enjoy ironically =(
just saw ep 15 of darling in the franxxx and holy shit this has to be one of the absolute worst episodes ive seen
mang0 getting invited by @NintendoAmerica is wild
Oh and I need a haircut
"to be clear, working out and eating better will give me more energy and performance in the long run, but setting routines takes a mental toll for sure"
"going to be on a grueling schedule to catch up again in DBFZ while not letting my melee skills slip... and start being more healthy... ugh its for the better though, been too long since a good win for me"
Also watched newest eps of Boku no hero and megalo box and theyre both very well done damn
On a positive note - haven't taken time to just listen to some good music in a while and man ive missed it
"Landed in london for my layover. Watched black panther on the flight, it was cool but honestly pretty let down after hearing how much everyone else liked it. Shitty fights (outside of sk car chase at least) and boring main storyline."
"I need to figure out something for the marth matchup for sure, but for now i will numb my hate for the matchup with some new shoes"
"Just gotta make sure to peak at the right time, and to learn to be more patient. Can't be too sad, played great in all but two sets and won teams and flatiron, but god damn  am i not satisfied. Next time!"
"Feeling better today after thinking/talking things through. This loss was one of the hardest in a while, I really felt that I was so close to winning it all until it all slipped away at the worst time.  Results will come though, I feel like I've played great like 90% of this trip"
woke up as a hungover 5th placer only to see the awful dbfz patchnotes Rough times
I said young man
i am tired and intoxicated but fuck man I hate losing so much
I am pinning this
I love @slime_machine For finding my phone
Is it that fucking hard to find jeans that fit
hard not to smile a little after that. Hope you enjoyed the commentary. Grats @MVG_Mew2King
Zain goes out in third Amazing run for sure but at the same time clearly hit a wall in armada Excited to see how he continues to improve from here!
"Armadas running a train, lets see if zain can stop it"
Literally felt even when he was up 3 stocks LOL
Fuck yes Insane play last game by armada
Come on armada..
"I'll be back, in one way or another. Thanks for the support, I don't say it enough but it helps me through the rough times. Hope you guys enjoy the rest of the matches!"
iTTT
Man I hate internet shitters acting as if they know anything at all about what it takes to try your heart out and still fail. Its seriously makes me hate people.
"Either way, summit was fun, well ran event but with some pretty bad TOing. Hope they fix it for dbfz summit.  Learned a lot playing everyone and I don't regret the time I've spent grinding at all, but I would be lying if I said I enjoy what melee seems to be turning into. Hm."
"Sorry if I let people down, i know people will tell me to camp etc but i just really didnt want to. I don't want to stop having fun with melee so I gotta do what I can to make the most out of lame players. sucks that I couldn't win at the same time."
"Didn't have it in me to tryhard after that awful winners set. Played OK, died to a couple stupid things like usual. Oh well."
"I just want to play good, thats all"
Its a marth day indeed
"Anyway, ill figure out what to do about that matchup when I have to, next up is losers, playing winner of hbox mango i believe"
"Ive asked everyone for help and i work on it all the time yet i just lose to one hit even remotely close to the edge, even when I am edgeguarding :/"
"got so much to say but ill wait until im out to salt, but fuck man that matchup is insanely frustrating..."
Plups sheik looking like a schnaaaaack
Zain is already the highest placing vote in ever and he is still in winners!
zains number neutral wins per kill was so fucking low that set damn good stuff @PG_Zain
Damn what a game
Is this the marth day?
I think im waiting for 11 sets + breaks now holy shit lmao
"gl to @aMSaRedyoshi in losers, give em hell!"
And @n3zModGod
shoutouts to netplay
If anyone going to summit plays yoshi that works too obv haha
"I will pay you if needed, plsss lmao"
Any good Yoshis on west coast who are willing to netplay early tomorrow? 10-12ish
Also C A R R I E D B Y T H E M E T A fkn told you
and after that set now a set where both people want to lose
FUCk YES
ONE TIME GOD
The outcome also probably decides who I play in winner quarters. it would be hard to make a worse format for this event even if you intentionally tried to
"Loser of 2saint Hugs plays sfat, winner plays wizzy. so basically both people are incentivized to throw..."
Dude this pools summit is even worse than I thought jfc
Man i am so happy to see good falco vs floaties again
"Ty for having me on commentary, time to prep for tomorrow"
"hope you guys are enjoying my commentary :0 ill do a bit more, hbox vs mango coming up soon"
i hope its obvious why people dont generally puff ditto - most people in smash just love the game/their characters too much to play such a matchup - but I really hope people start pressuring hbox in different matchups.
"Great to see @2Saintt do well tho, good shit"
rank #100 was close to possibly winning vs rank #1 and i just wanted it to end tbh. also hbox is carried by puff('s position in the meta)
Dddd
Summit content is so goo
#NewProfilePic
Someone send me a hires photo of the thor/loki pic pls @BTSsmash @BeyondTheSummit
when we lost WFs i thought long and hard about how fucking annoying mango would be if he won and that gave me all the motivation I could ever need
Back to back champsss Good shit @ArmadaUGS
Losers run again it is
Fuck i threw so hard
Anyway regardless I played well today and had tons of fun playing melee :))
"1 day later ""leffen only complains about stuff that screws him over"""
"To be clear - I clearly benefitted from this system, and you can't rerun the matches, but please fucking fix how you do the tiebreakers. Now."
"The seed system is basically - lets have an insanely stupid system that is hard to understand, with huge flaws, just to try to prevent all versions of intentional throwing, which wouldn't happen anyway"
Summit pool system being trash? Shocker.
"Stoked that im doing well though, but mostly because it seems like I can still manage both dbfz and melee, somehow :) inb4 i get last place at the summit of power tho :-:"
"Won my pool only dropping one game! Played amazing vs Sfat/Wes, but vs plup we both played sloppy :/ I'll see you in wfs big guy"
"made it to WF in dubs, time for singles soon"
okay reddit thats enough for tonight goodnight
"having a lot of fun with smash regardless though, no matter what happens tomorrow i'm excited as fuck to see my playstyle evolve further"
i wanna play amazing in the tournament tomorrow.
"That said, puff is obviously stronger than normal in crew type events, so lets see how we all do vs thanos in singles!"
yeye i know ill get flamed by idiots saying that fox puff is 7-3 in theory but idc. Most players would trade only playing one slightly disadvantaged matchup that almost no one gets good practice in rather than prep for 10+ different ones.
"ive been saying this but its still true - everyone, including myself, are still underestimating puff. If we want to win we have to treat it like we are coming in with a disadvantage, with how strong jiggs players are at the few matchups they play. Its ride or die peeps"
so fucking tired of jigglypuff winning shit tbh this entire year in melee im going to dedicate to fucking up this busted ass character or maybe just play dbfz until someone else figures it out lmao
Hopefully my team carries me :)
"blergh, playing sloppy, gotta clean it up for tomorrow"
im so sad i dont have anyone to play yugioh with at the summit
Getting wobbled for 200%? Sounds like a choice to me

"its so out of character for me, i can't believe i let myself fall this far, and now im paying the price."
"i am confessing something, ive have been suffering from a cold for the past two days, and still do. i havent been brave enough to tell the world in fear of the imminent comments about ""how im sick all the time"" - im afraid i fell off the wagon, i shook several fans hands at FI3."

i will stream tomorrow!!
i truly hope that zamasu will be a viable character with depth and a good assist
"emotional trauma is not the only source of creative thought, bruH"
"i consider my personal rock-bottom when i succumbed to buying the ""leffe"" beer for mang0. despite it being an attempt at satire it really wasn't any better then the supreme brick."
"as flattering as you may think it is, you're not being clever by calling every spacie player under 200 lbs/every fictional character with an attitude a ""leffen"" - this stale commentary, just as the tier list you leeched from reddit, adds nothing of value to this world"
"your randall-only tech skill routine does nothing but ensure your incoming skill plateau, and your custom controller covered with stickers is not rad, it only further emphasizes your complete lack of color cordination."
"face your flaws and learn from them shield drop not because you can, but because it was right at that moment realize that your gimmicks not working doesn't mean that youre ""just playing bad today"" - no, youre always bad. and lets all aspire to wear less anti social social club"
"and your only gameplay change is that you learned shield dropping 3 years too late and die more often from attempted ledgedashes.  while your execution test based playstyle looks differently, it is still equally as sad.  i should add more monologues to my script."
"i know change and self reflection is frightening to many of you,  whose only change in appearance since brawl came out has been buying a pair of adidas boost and filling your wardrobe with more clothes that attempt to hide your emerging beer belly -"
"in reality i decided to make it look different on purpose, its just one of my many lovable antics that i came up with for the upcoming anime adaption"

"I love when I make people sign on for the ""4% of laser damage means you need to run in right now"" or ""not knowing how to cg in 2018 is okay"" or the ""marth has a reason to not ledgecamp at high %"" and especially the famous one all suckers fall for ""fox has a punish game on marth"""

"and while I don't think Hax or the boxx team has malicious intent, he has in the past done and said several things in the past which makes it both hard to trust his word/conclusions and prove that he is not above leveraging his position in the community to questionable degrees."
"regardless of how much you idolize hax or want box style controllers to be legal, this is a player/company which makes it is obviously extremely prone to bias, it should be read just like cigaratte/sugar companies paying for studies on their own product."
"jokes aside I'm happy that we FINALLY have some actual information to discuss on the B0XX (altho just by skimming the document, it mentions fox specific stuff wayyy too much and pretty subjectively jumps to conclusions a lot of the time)  now if only the 5/ 25 wasnt useless"

"seriously tho, there is no way the west will be able to keep up with japan in dbfz if you guys keep playing ps4 - even good local scenes can not really replace good online."
(first being WNF)
"also, this is the second time ive played offline, all other practice is online on pc. Stop being scrubs and play the game version with actual playable online and you too can get good practice :d"
"As for dragon ball wise, it was great testing myself and learning from playing everyone! Feel like I've proved that I'm at least the best player in EU (for now!), but I gotta level up more to beat the best. @GO13151 I will be much stronger next time ;)!"
"Things such as doing winners first in top 8, waiting 3 hours for one match twice in one day, and no Bo5 even when theres clearly time ang setups will frustrate me to no end."
"About to fly back home to Sweden! It was fun, altho I wish the fgc would get some better scheduling and organization :v standard is def lower than smash tournaments, but it was still a good event all things considered! Back to streaming tomorrow!"

"time for some MAJOR practice leaving for brussel tomorrow, lets learn this team and hit some ToDs"
a21 match start tod vs any char
number 1 cellout EU some practice with my new team before brussel this weekend
i think too often about what bleach couldve been if it remained stylish/visually interesting/not utter shit
ive become too wholesome
Cute selfie attempts with @GARMAKILMA  never taking a picture again
if someone has a better 21 team than 21/cell/vegeta im alll ears btw
if you can call vegeta assist and block to get half your hits and be proud of yourself im jealous as fuck i gotta learn that delusional tech
"teambuilding and cool synergy is my favorite thing about team based fighting games, but this game simply isnt balanced/tuned to promote that. If I want to compete in this game I just gotta accept that everyone is going to play the same shit"
its just sad that this game has such fucking awful assists and low diversity but at this point if I want to pick 21 im either going to intentionally play a mid tier team or play the same chars as everyone else. hopefully arcsys patches this game quickly (yeah right)
spending hours and hours in the lab trying to not see the obvious  21/cell/vegeta is the best 21 team and i am going to be a cellout until bamco patches this game
also hes stupid vs chars with 7 frame jabs lmao
"what do people think about bardock feels like hes really good vs some teams, esp tall chars, and then utter trash vs some chars"
lets go    #BrusselsChallenge via @smashgg
the best bardock world returns for ranked shit trying to figure out whether or not i should sell out and play top tiers :/
"ive myself (and im sure other top players) received unprovoked harassment/hatred both in person and offline, and while ive gotten used to it at this point, no one should have to. fucking stop. please."
"regardless of who it is and why you hate them, that's just being an asshole.  (inb4 people think mutual dislike is the same thing as unprovoked harassment)"
don't hate people over what character they play and don't fucking harass them in public unprovoked. sad that this is an issue in this day and age but here we are.
"No stream today cuz easter, but here, have a bardock complitation from the bardock god himself ;) RT Etc!"
21/bardock/cell = the dream team?
wait heir is capped just woke up  LOL @zaik_ssbm
the best bardock on planet earth now streaming
took a nap ended up sleeping like 7 hours jet lag is lovely
time to weeb up streaming first playthru of Persona 5
BEST BARDUCK EU learning bardock all day
since going to japan I always try matcha flavors wherever I go and theyre always such a fucking letdown
"(score could change with time tho, watched it all quickly so my perspective is warped)"
"Finished full metal alchemist brotherhood, it exceeded my expectations for sure. Few surprises and it didn't have the highest peaks, but it was always entertaining and very solid throughout. OPs/EDs were amazing. 9/10"
"bout to board my first flight out of 3 -_- got some quick melee in tho, man this game is fun Can't wait to play everyone again Cya"
Come play with me and @MW_Buster  Gate a16
gonna play some airport melee with @MW_Buster  sup
"Not sure what i think about go1 putting 21 at 5th best in DBFZ/same tier as cell. Personally I don't think shes overall that good, but with more tech and a great team she could potentially be low top tier"
"Here at the IND airport foodcourt for a while (flight at 8), anybody trying to play some melee/yugioh/dbfz?"
"Just got up What are people doing today, my flight is at 8PM Anybody wanna share a ride"
Ngl I just can't let melee have more bad grand finals LOL
i'll have to see but rn im feeling flatiron for sure
"Biggest takeaway from this tournament is I think I can manage both DBFZ and melee. Gotta think more on it but I think if I just adjust my schedule and plan well I think I can win in melee while improving in dbfz. If I can do this well with barely nothing, a bit more should do it."
"Full bloom 4 was an amazingly run event btw, big shoutouts. Glad I went even after how things ended!"
*grands*
"GL to mango in winners, one day we will have a set where both of us play good lmao"
"Welp, played completely awful and just ran into shit, oh well can't be too upset all things considered. GGs everyone, learned a lot about what to do next time!"
Gonna try to work on it in lf/gfs! I think I can do this if I just minimize the damage of my fuckups somewhat
My DI/techs are sooo bad hahaja
moving fast and having fun Got no idea how im gonna implement that vs hbox tho
I need a falcoooo plss
Any falco/puffs wanna help ya leff warm up
Too hungry to find proper food Its all downhill from here
Relapsed
My yu gi oh luck is non existant wtf
"Also fk marth fox fkn degenerate matchup Gotta learn marth asap, I can't keep relying on getting three times as many neutral hits"
Thought I was going to lose and then I remember that dash back grabbing twice per second is really just like super dash spam from dbfz gGs zain hope this shows u gotta play some neutral game ;)
"anyway gonna try to sleep, staying off twitter for the majority of tomorrow so I'll cya guys later."
"tournaments for melee before june is probably going to be: GOML Summit Smash&amp;Splash/Flatiron are maybes  so yeah im still going to be around, pls calm down if you think I'm quitting melee LOL"
"anyway ty all for being so supportive, shoutouts to you (also to @TeamSoloMid&lt;3)"
he deleted it LUL
some people SMH
it didn't exist a couple years ago ya dumbo
"anyway that feels good to type out, hope people don't take it the wrong way. I've been focusing on dbfz for a while already, so this is really just an announcement of when I'll be back to playing melee 100% again.  the date may move up if I get salty at adult gohan/16 tho LMAO"
"This is simply something I wanted to let you all know for the next few months. TLDR: Prioritizing DBFZ until early June, will still play melee on the side, aiming to go completely serious on melee after that."
"Don't get me wrong however, I am definitely going to do my best tomorrow, I'm already here and it would be a crime not to try if I have even a 0.5% chance of stopping a HBox GF hehe, and it's great practice regardless. I will be off social media for tomorrow though just FYI."
"Tournaments are incredibly exhausting, even outside of jetlag, everytime you are risking being the target of all the toxic keyboard warriors and as much as I wish I could just ""not care"" it just doesn't work like that. The risk/reward  isn't worth it unless the reward is winning."
"Winning is everything to me, and I've realized throughout this trip that if I'm not practicing to win, just to do ""alright"", I simply don't have the motivation to play at all and just end up wasting time I could've spent practicing DBFZ/streaming/resting up."
"I will still attend a few select tournaments for Melee, as long as they are at good dates &amp; I have ample time to practice up before they happen. If I want to play both it is simply not worth the time to go to events that I won't be able to perform my best at&amp;I hate having an OS"
"Been thinking hard and long about my melee/DBFZ decision and I've decided to make a decision now instead of waiting until after Full Bloom, because of the risk of me not thinking clearly due to a loss/win. Until DBFZ Summit in early June I will put prioritize DBFZ but -"
Playing ygo on stream
Practice melee or ygo tournament??
Marbles0da (pls send me free shit)
"Made it out in winners! Scary match vs Ghatzu, ggs. My melee is rusty but at least DBFZ kept my adaptation and clutch fresh!"
"i dont understand how i can be this jetlagged from a 2 hour difference. Pools in an hour, gotta chug caffeine and make this work somehow"
Who wants to play ygo tonight
Im happy they found infinite glitches in DBFZ hope itll get arcsys lazy ass to patching gohan too :)
"My heart is telling me ""just play both fully"" but I'm not sure if my hands/personal life would last a year trying to be the best in two games with little overlap. If I could be satisfied with just being top level at both itd be fine, but I really am a #1 or nothing person hehe"
"It sucks, I definitely feel like am at a crossroad of wanting to give it all in melee but DBFZ is also really fresh and exciting, don't know what to do maaaaaaaan"
"I got so many ideas for DBFZ that I wanna try and implement, but maan, gotta learn to focus on one game at a time. GO1 callout got me flattered/hyped lmao, I don't think I'm at his or sonicfoxes level but I believe if I had access to constant practice/tournaments I could be :("
"That said, I'm really interested in how GO1 techs throws, input wise, because sonicfox wasnt punishing him for it, felt like most grabs that hit were more due to it being surprise/in a weird spot rather than a RPS mixup"
"Main thought on sonicfox-go1 is that it really showed how much better a16/cell/gohans offense are. Having to rely on dragon rushes and mixups with big gaps that do less damage than a simple high low is not good enough already, and it will only get worse from here."
"Fun little sesh with norwalk, still feeling rusty as fuck but its still doing a lot better than just 2 days ago, gonna make the most out of tomorrow and saturday and try to pull it all together for sunday"
"Heard @GO13151 wants to play me wow, not sure if I can beat him but I'm down if we go to same tournament soon!"
streaming a lil DBFZ/Melee before heading out to Mangos last stream until after Full Bloom!
"dont think ill be invited to the smashbros invitational, but itd be cool since dbfz summit is right after heh"
"I definitely wanna keep going to DBFZ events tho, just gotta learn to somehow manage both games cuz right now I've been playing wayyyyyy too little melee.  #leffenfordbfzsummit"
"Time to take a break from dbfz and practice melee tho, at least if I get upsetted in pools at Full bloom I've at least showed that I wasn't just slacking off haha"
"Woo I did it! Won WNF, proved that I aint just some fraudulent online warrior lmao GGs to everyone, lots of great games, and shoutouts to the scene being so nice to me :)"
"Up again, 2am WF haha Lets see if I can still play :)"
"Woo that was fuckin anime lmao GGs, made it to WF of my first ever dbfz tournament :0"
Up vs tatsu next... Literally no idea on how nappa works Help
"Sloppier set than when we played online lmao, ggs cloud! Made it to top 8 winners woo"
"Wew had something wrong with my binds but clutched it, gotta step it up for next match"
Playing now
"my card isnt working, anyone who can get me cash for paypal here at wnf lmao"
"Planned on streaming today, but I didn't realize WNF would be 1-3 hours away from me depending on traffic &gt;_&lt; Headed out now, hope I can play some good people and see how good/trash I am!"
yo anyone who is going to WNF who can let me borrow a ps4 stick :)?
"I sure hope the DLC chars spice up the game a lot tho, because shits getting stale real quick imho"
Long ass day i was def too tired to deal with online dbfz today lmao. Ty guys for watching anyway
aight switching to some DBFZ now! prep for WNF tomorrow :o any good socal PC players hmu
"big leff practicing with mang0 and other socal goons gonna do some melee grinding today, dbfz later tonight"
"ty all for watching stream, was a lot of fun! also with every day my hate for gohan grows stronger lmfao"
american leff trying american dbfz ranked any good dbfz players on westcoast who wanna play (PC) hmu
not gonna lie tho taking it easy is starting to bore me Cant wait to try my ass of the entire rest of the year
Dry ass chicken Good sauce Pretty cheap Lemonade too sweet 6/10
So hungry  Trying this raising canes place Lets see
Practice starts tomorrow Tonight tho
Fun tournament
Definitely
"Fun set. Ggs to West, def learned a lot about what my marth sucks at, definitely gotta learn how to scramble better and improve at dealing with full jumps. Gonna do some commentary now :)"
"Who I play in losers depends on the matchup, I'll try to make it back on stream to redeem myself lmao"
Turns out mewtwo is worse than android 21 :(
"got the craziest urge to play mewtwo Sloppy mewtwo vs lameout falco aint gonna work tho Good shit squid, amazing dair haha"
"Won my first match vs Jace 2-1, fun set! Also damn my marth is so bad at edgeguarding falcon :v"
Also the vip lounge has a private bar Oh noooo
Made it Match before me wasnt even done yet hehe
In the lyft now pool at 2PM Eta 2:09 I got a bye tho Pls NO DQ
Amazing set Really felt like it was gohan vs 16 going off that decided the matches Patch when
yOOOO
So hyped for this GFs
Trying to watch all of top 8 at final round and not get DQd from my pool...
"when was the last time I sandbagged other than pheonix blue? (small swedish tournament lol)  it is literally once or twice a season, and never at big tournaments. No one is giving shit to m2k/armada/plup for not entering The Mango at all, are they also just insecure?"
go fuck yourself. Pls God
sorry if this upsets people who subbed/fucking up seeding altho to be fair it was like 99% dbfz subs lmao
"most likely playing marth tomorrow if jetlag doesnt fix itself by tomorrow, works out well since I want to have him ready for when marth players learn bnbs and i dont have a working non-ucf controller lol"
"been extremely jetlagged, not in the sleep schedule wake up late way, but in the ""headache and extreme tiredness"" havent been able to do shit today, rip"
"All in all I just hope we somehow find tech that actually makes the top 3 weaker or that arcsys wakes up and patches the game asap, i really think the game is going to suffer massively in team diversity if nothing changes"
"and his unique mechanic (level up) is barely relevant, only lvl 1 really matters and hes broken even without it. He would be so much more interesting if he started out ass and then eventually became stronger -_-"
i havent even watched the match yet but yeah adult gohan is so badly designed imo How do you give a character that neutral + that autopilot 30 second pressure + best defense in the game + arguably highest damage and not realize something is wrong lmao. Flawless while on screen.
"Lets be real, if ya didnt have a significant amount sidebetted on GO1 yet still claim now that it was ""obvious"", are you guys just stupid or do you hate money"
just landed SUP
"on the way to LA! Tired as fuck like usual. Got an 11 hour direct flight to relax on tho, hopefully I haven't lost the ability to sleep on planes :0"
I just registered for The Mango   #themango via @smashgg
ok just got told the mango isnt ucf do i go to final round instead xd
last minute tech skill derust before leaving for the MANGOO gonna break in new controller and stuff
Last stream before going to the US! a little bit of dbfz/melee :)
ah the eternal problem where fighting game players refuse to try new technology went through this same thing with melee netplay (still do tbh)  hopefully the dbfz community someday realize how utter trash ps4 online is
"(not advocating for tournaments to be run on pc, that would obv remove the biggest benefit)"
1-2 frames on PC feels like offline on PS4 - really sad most good players would rather play underwater =(
does anyone have input lag comparisons for DBFZ for PS4/PC? blows my mind that pro players play ps4 online with how awful it feels compared to pc
slow day
serious git gud stream dbfz/melee later
weird stream but i enjoyed ranting about things ty for watching/discussing
chill stream day dbfz&amp;melee&amp;yugioh lul
"Imo this game really nailed the lower/middle tier balance extremely well, but the top tiers are so oppressive that it feels like a massive disadv if you dont run 1 of them"
If you removed cell/16/gohan/vegeta assist from dbfz the game would be so much better :&lt;
"alright, starting stream, last day for the mango subgoal, 50 subs left... lets fucking do this starting with Dragon ball"
really chill lil dbfz stream
honestly fucking unbelievable that the TOs let the set be played out in that condition
real puff temperatures
"Ty for watching, might be back later with more streaming cuz I really wanna go to the mangoo"
the MANGO subgoal - melee with the boyes playing melee/talking eglx/smash5 etc
feeling like im gonna lose to some execution tester and then do much better the tournament after Prepare your reddit threads for that sweEET KARMAaa
Been watching eglx First good smash in a while I should start practicing again lul
smash 2 with the BOys
felt bad for not streaming for a bit so heres a nighttime dbfz stream
no offense to smash 4 but im happy it seems like a new game and not just a port with new chars
i hope it will have good gameplay and online
new smash tweet
back with more the XXFULLSCREENSUPERDASHER99XX is at it again
Well if you dont get an explication you are forced to use your own critcal thinking to determine why the tier list is the way it is. You add your own narrative instead of someone elses
great argument
mewtwo essay No good way to deal with Crouch Cancel  Really big hurtbox - his massive tail can get hit aka hes super easy to hit  Very floaty so he dies super easily  Decent combo game vs fast fallers like fox but vs floaties his combo game is pretty abysmal  He has a bunch of go
heres a tier list with some actual thought put behind it
The fact that people care about tier lists without any reasoning or explanation is really cool! really proves how humanity is fucking DONe
afternoon dbfz
okay the future dbfz summit champ (KAPPA) is back at streaming again sub goal for the mango/also WNF for DBFZ?
(not specifically aimed at typo or whatever but its actually insane how often you have to hear guys protect their precious masculinity over fucking taste buds)

sunday afternoon dbfz like usual trying to find some challenging dbfz players in eu...
saturday dragonballin come hang
Upload an hour long analysis of ChrisG vs SonicFox from Winter Brawl! Really interesting to see the two of the best go at it and the adaptation throughout both sets. RTs appreciated as usual ;)

Return of the dbfz stream Gonna try learning kid buu/maybe others Also possibly analyzing chrisg/sonicfox if people are interested
woke up and watched winterbrawl top 8 ...god damn sonicfox with the download
"ChrisGs sparking usage was so smart - knowing vegeta is a bad comeback character he spent it to keep his team intact and got a ton of meter of it as well. Great match, shame it was so early in bracket"
how good is kid buu? What is his weaknesses/strengths and what position does he work best in?
pheonix blue was great really enjoyed myself and showed off how fucking godlike I am till next time
how does 21/a. Gohan work? @Alioune85
we couldnt find fast food so we re injecting garbage visually instead

could prob be optimized for damaged still  @FluxedOver @faultydefense @VasedCoopa
"Found a consistent, practical and high damage extension with Android 21+ Cell assist! This is from 2m but it works from all types of confirms.  Notes: delay dive+assist call slightly, after dive instant dash into super jump, i recommend using the shortcut."
Esp how to extend combos with cell assist with a21 Shits a nightmare of inconsistency
Can some labmonsters find tech and practical assist combos with my team a21/cell/a16 pls The cool tech gets a free sub or money or some shit :d
nothing makes me love melee more than playing against superdash/vanish/a16 online lmaooo Ty for watching
a quick hit of dbfz ranked before bed lets get salty
turns out im still alright at melee
first real ass melee stream since genesis come chill and watch me be rusty

"ty all for tuning in, im hungry and exhausted shoutouts to everyone that beat me today, ill get you next time"
afternoon dbfz ranked/chill sub tournament research as well
"and yeah quitting melee and letting hword run shit is complelely out of the question. Maybe if things change tho, I'll def be playing/streaming dbfz on the side whenever I can"
"All this is just making me wish I had time to play dbfz seriously tbh, most fun ive had with a new fighting game in a loong time. Sadly when the melee season starts again it won't be viable for me to kee p up both, maybe if I had lived in the US :("

"pro tip: if your combo isnt ending in a setup and it doesnt kill, dont do it. ""max damage combos"" that use 2 assists are practically worthless in a real match"
the more I play dbzf the more i realize how its just literally reskinned mvc3 with some balance changes
i dont want to play vegeta but his assist is so fucking good and most others barely do anything
heres some proof in case r kappa didnt believe me pretty proud of myself considering i didnt get an early copy or play the beta at all

"""just crouching heavy super rush"" is the freshest day 1 meme"

didnt win dbzf so i bought it home now and will stream soon does anyone know how to unlock android 21 lul
"tldr on dbzf impressions so far +looks great, very beginner friendly at first, good quality throughout - most chars both look and play very similarly, some gameplay mechanics might tweaking, will prob be brutal to newcomers once tech is found  very excited to stream the game soon"
"i feel like death but im going to a pre release dbzf pre release tournament thing today because while i might collapse any second and most likely lose to people whove actually played the game, maybe ill win a second copy of the game and this time ill actually get it"
watched two episodes of darlingg in the FranshdXxahdposahd and im convinced some billionare bribed a bunch of talented animators to make his evangelion doujin into a full scale anime
i am awake really sick and really craving for all the japanese food on my timeline =(
man everyone with these early dbfz copies wish i had enough clout to get one
heres some proof (happy leffer)
"oh yeah i won a copy of dragon ball z fighters from @BandaiNamcoUS @BandaiNamcoNO and I was told they'd contact me before the games release to receive it (gave phone #, email and adress) but I haven't heard anything so far and the game comes out in 2 days  did ya scam me?"

"Great games and well ran tournament, shoutouts to everyone who made it happened! Hope there's another valhalla soon."
Year of the leffeb
"Top 64*, sorry. Still tons of time since we have tons of setups"
"Found out top 32 is starting 10 AM tomorrow (top 8 isnt until 6:30)  Zzzzzz It's 10:20PM and theres plenty of teams is still left. I'm not even in teams so i'm not harmed by this at all (helped, arguably) but its really sad to see the players get screwed over by a bad schedule"
"valhalla been nice and chill so far, great practice for the upcoming year :)"
man smash tournaments are exhausting sometimes Gotta get used to it again -_-
Marth is so fun
is there anything worse than a hot smash venue
only entering singles here at valhalla so im just big chillin today and tomorrow
after a long trip  i have now arrived at my hotel here in denmark @zaik_ssbm has to stay with me cuz he accidentally booked a hotel in another city lmaoo
"see ""i will still discuss it within the 25"" this was written when we were supposed to discuss UCF within the 25 next week before they didnt say anything and then announced a podcast and a secret solution"
for everyone who wants brown haired leffen back  heres him in game form #ad @esportslife
fun lil stream will try to IRL tomorrowww
new year lets get it valhalla tomorrow talking bout UCF/Genesis too
i am done with haircut  (   gonna stream soon stay tuned
the new year has just started and im already mad oh well gonna focus on finding good controllers i  guess
"""in the coming days we will have a podcast"" meanwhile: the 5: ""we will decide on UCF amendment by the 27th dec""  smashbox devs: ""est shipping date aug 2017""  hax: ""i will not apply for summit before clearing up boxx legality"" + below tweet  can't wait for the podcast in 2020"
let the past die
Gonna go get my hair cut now in a way I have not yet decided woo
This is just brutal but this is honestly just straight up the 5 failing the competitive players and everyone else who's attendance mightve been affected by UCF. If this mismanagment keeps happening I will certainly not remain on the 25.  Sigh.
"i don't really have a problem with a major not using a beta version but the way this done was absolutely terribly.  The 25 was supposed told we were going to vote on UCF a long time ago but the 5 failed to complete the amendment in time. And this ""show"" is a fucking joke."
"won weekly fun stuff, melee is so sick"
at my first weekly in a long timeee Rusty but happy to be playing again valhalla this weekend to gotta get back in shape asap

Not going to be involved with the B0XX debate publicly.  Me and @ssbmhax talked a lot during summit and due to our past history I think its best I stay out of it for now. I will still discuss it within the 25 and I look forward to seeing more info about potential solutions!

"Landed, waiting for the airport train now! Everything went smoothly, but neither of us could sleep so we are tired to say the least -_-"
"Gonna try my best to IRL a bunch in Japan btw, stay tuned :)"
"Super proud of Jennie, we out here waiting for our flight despite her fear of flying :) helsinki next, then tokyo! @GARMAKILMA &lt;3"
"gonna make myself stop playing games with online matchmaking games in 2018, i've gotten the to the top ranks in YGO/overwatch/battlerite/marvel/sfv past year and I think its actually hurting my motivation to improve in melee since I get that satisfaction easier in other games"
"Made it to the highest rank in Duel Links!  Literally last game before I had to head to the airport. pretty cheap/easy deck to make, would recommend if you can learm how to play it!"
My japan trip goals : - food - fashion - rhythm games
"Leaving for japan tomorrow morning ahhhh what do i need to not forget? Also, might squeeze in one last stream tonight :)"
"menat looks fun tho, might mess around with her a little before release. sad it isnt in arcades or I wouldve played it in japan"
"gonna give sfv a new chance for AE, but honestly the main gameplay is prob just not for me so itll come down to one of the new characters being really fun"

Man ya boi needs another twitch party band :(
"2017 wasnt my year but i guess it couldve been worse considering I was playing catch up Proud of the work I put in regardless of how it, learned a lot about myself and melee.  gonna go relax now, maybe even go to the after party, now with a clean conscience for once."
"All in all not too upset, feeling better now than I did last couple weeks because the year is officially, finally, over. I gotta take a real break for now, ill make sure I come back stronger and motivated to put in the hours for next year. I got this."
"To be real for a second tho (i know ill get shat on for this but oh well): Obviously played really sloppy this tournament, got no one but myself to blame, i didnt put in the work I usually do and wizzy and armada punish you real hard for that. Happy i played ok in winners tho"
Played amazing but it just wasnt enough!! grrrrr??!
Wow i played so smart and great!! Great games Haha!!
Haha funny Jokekeeeeeeee Winner finals made it!! :D

"Felt like trash the day before finals day at summit too, but at least I had a reason to be sad so it was easier to deal with. Now I just feel sad and shitty for no reason. idk why im sharing any of this since people just hate on me for being open about how I feel. guess i'll stop"
just feeling worse and worse tbh def playing like trash as well i hate feeling like this fucking depressing tbh
"Probably just winter depressed/vitamin D deficient like half of sweden tbh, havent seen the sun in a month"
I blame it of shitty sleep and american politics
"Not sure why im feeling so meh, think its a combination of things. I'm planning on playing fox but def a chance I'll go marth as well/instead since I want to potentially use him in the future and I could use the experience. We'll see. Sorry for being a bitch"
"feeling really weird about this tournament honestly, got no motivation to play at all for some reason. I'll try to play well as I can anyway for the fans, i guess. Hope I wake up feeling better tomorrow."
"Also, they misheard my name and entered me as ""Leffe"" lul"
"Won the dragon ball tournament without dropping a character in about 40mins. Never played it outside of half an hour yesterday. Won the game, some plushie and a gamer headset lmfao Worth"

do i get 5th over plup if I beat armada 2x and wizzy in semis or some shit please give me a reason not to play battlerite instead
Not gonna lie motivation to practice for dreamhack is real low since it feels like the year is already over. Gonna try my best to pull through with discipline tho :0

after not touching a controller after getting 3-0d by armada/3-1d by hungrybox ive learned that im a far worse human being without melee
Went outside for the first time since I got back 0/10 will not do again
Trying to stay at a decent body temperature in sweden during the winter is some real difficult shit man
I'm happy someone else is spreading the gospel @NARMAK13

sick and miserable tweet #6
being this sick is so annoying i just want to do stuff but my body is not having it :( guess this is a good excuse to relax and watch anime (Ôø£.Ôø£)
wholesome leff is starting now until next tournament at least lmao im sorry everyone i am shit at keeping things together I will keep trying
alright alright Im pulling out want to think as little as possible of that liar. esp when im sick LOL. pce
the best thing about being sick is getting taken care of the people who stay true to you even in the worst of times  mario is that dude been here since day 1 and you know hes showin up my girlfriends cool too i guess
woke up still really sick And computer instead of instantly crashing now freezes and then bluescreens after 10 minutes is this my punishment
"seems like it might be something weird with my cpu, before it bluescreen fans go ham and throttlestop (which I used before) now says ""cpu not supported""  wtffffffff"
laptop just bluescreens every 5 minutes Even after reinstalling windows Wtf do I do

just gonna chill out from social media for a while and play mario and yugioh will stream a lot soon tho
sweden is so cold and dark like my soul homefeelsgoodman
"and yeah hbox winning doesnt make his awful off camera personality any better. But congrats, you got this year. See you in 2018 bitch."
"Back in Sweden.  Will be nice with a break from traveling, can't let up working hard yet tho. Can't just sit down and take this shit ;)"
This is the Op of the post. The fact that these posts aren't all downvoted through the floor is actually so fucking funny
"i was thinking, what should we do to beat hungrybox? as if it were fate, i came upon this reddit thread. Now I know exactly what not to do!"
Shoutouts to all the fans and my amazing sponsors for somehow enduring my tantrums. Hopefully I get better at this eventually.
I still believe the bad system and not telling anyone was 100% on summit and a major fuckup but it was also an honest mistake. I'm sorry.
"Thinking back, I'm sorry for how I handled the summit pool situation. I've been trying to get better at it but I wasn't prepared for this-"
London heathrow we meet again 7 hr layover  I may sometimes have the emotional stability of a 5 yo but I. Will. Get. Through. This. @_@
Is there anything I can buy for my summit money that will make me forget losing. Pls give suggestion
who wants to get food i want ramen
Still a lil drunk not gonna lie
its alright
Okay not gonna lie this last tequila shot hurt ya boi
Summit recap video def makes me wanna go rewatch your name for the 4th time ngl
Lost the tournament Not cool
Won like 15 grand this summit. Cool
Summit three was my first real event back. One year later I really feel like I'm back to where I left off. Excited as fuck for next year.
...summit was amazing. Despite the format its still overall easily the most enjoyable event all year.  I'll see you all next year.
Did alright this weekend all things considered. Happy I tried my best and played well at times. Time to relax and chill with the homies :)
"Aw. Completely ran out of steam after beginning of game one. Armada played great though, really hoping he takes GF! gl man"
Ouch
I am here on mobile twitter browser to let you know I have somehow made it to WF of Summit. What a rush. Ggs
I am here on mobile browser twitter to tell everyone that told me I shouldn't quit that they were right.
"I may not have much left in the tank after everything thats happened, but I promise that I'll give everything that I can. Let's do this."
New day.  Deleting twitter app cuz im getting triggered already LUL Cya all later.
Got confirmation that bracket is final and nothing is changing gonna do my best to win anyway hopefully this time I actually benefit from it
This was in the official ruleset sent to us before the event
"Ruleset was not told to me or anyone else as far as I know, you had to personally ask. I assumed 1st seeds picks because of this :"
"Have never even thought of retiring from melee before, but today really has made me realize that I can't mentally keep this up forever."
Extremely upset and sad that bad luck and others incompetence keeps destroying everything I work so hard for.
"I still think that they should fix it somehow, maybe with a random draws for each seed, but I don't want them to be forced into it by me."
I've decided to play tomorrow. My mentality is completely fucked and I doubt I'll be able to perform but I don't like blackmailing people.
Never thought I'd feel bad for giving my everything to comeback and win a set vs a top 6 player but I guess life is full of surprises
So fucking sad.
Its honestly actually unbelievable how much bad luck follows me recently. I just wish TOs could stop fucking me over.
"I'm not sure how you can make such a terrible format, not tell anyone and still i'm the one who has to pay for it."
Dont want to play if in tournaments that punish me for winning. Most likely not playing if it doesn't get changed.
"At the very least, if the situation happens where both people want to fortfeit, then they should play the set for the choice."
"Exactly, and the pool order was random (we were pool C yet we still played last)."
You seriously can't round round robin pools if thats the format. Encouraging people to throw is fucking stupid.
"You cant actually be serious with the bracket setup btw, why the fuck didnt they tell people ahead of time?"
What a slobberknocker. Ggs
"Won every event so far, singles coming up tonight tho. Hoping I play well, but regardless summit has been sick. Melee is amazing."
Myself included
Wish everyone could be as graceful as Faker in defeat
Swedennnnn Also LOL salt
kaiba is my spirit animal
surprised more didnt guess it since mafia almost always destroys town really quickly at summits rishi def shouldve guessed it lmfao
this bamboozle happened to us when we played in sweden we actually realized it when we were down to 3. fun times lmfao
lmfao get fucked twitch chat/reddit  aint so easy is it almost thought rishi would realize since I told him about this yday LOL

what is even happening in season 3 of ygo
Wanted to go to the afterparty but came down with a massive headache so im staying in; __ ;
ü§ê
"M2K: ""whats the optimal drink choice"" armada: ""the optimal choice is to stop wasting our time yason"""
I'm just takin it out in the right way and at the right people
People calling me wholesome now explains why yall fall for hbox LMAO
I think going back to my roots and taking out my anger/hatred through melee is doing wonders
"Feels like my mental game has never been better honestly, really picked it up after GTX. Now to fuse it with amazing ingame play ü§î"
Proud of myself for playing solidly and keeping it together mentally despite having an off day execution wise.  M2K just played even better!
"what a GFs, rollercoaster. Learned a lot, super excited to apply it for Summit!  Great play and congrats teammate @MVG_Mew2King !"
Fox player pls help me warmup :(
and thats okay.
Aight.
Any marth player who can help me warmup :0 @Nightmare6God weon x?
Been preparing for top 8 all morning by watching yugioh
Canada cup has been sick so far. Really well ran! Hyped for top 8 tomorrow and the afterparty :)
"Marvel is really fun, might enter it again sometime!  Ty for the FGC for being mad nice to me lmao"
"Ahh, lost to @eliverling in losers finals! Tight games, almost made the sickest solo dorm comeback. Happy he made it through after all, GL!"
"Made it back to loser semis, where I were before the pool got remade.  actually so done with this LOL, i wanna eat and play melee"
I lost to the cheater in winners LOL  How do I manage to be the center of all drama even in marvel
Made it to losers semis of my pool Now they are saying one guy entered twice and theyre redoing everything lol
In losers for marvel 0_0
Now to go 0-2 in marvelll
Made it to top 8 winners side beating Ryan Ford 3-0! Didn't play super on point today but I kept it together and pushed through :)
bracket day lets go boys
anyway phew time to move on all i can do is beat his as in game so i will try lmfao
"people calling me ""just salty"" man, you see me shitting on armada m2k plup or lovages personality? im up vs hbox this season even LOL"
"im not gonna write a book on why but unlike him I cant fake it and pretend to like him, so yeah im gonna be straight up. also beef is nice."
ftr i have nothing against hbox or his jigglypuff. hes amazing and i have nothing against his playstyle everything against him as a person
me and @MVG_Mew2King somehow won doubles despite our first ever teams friendly being today.  my teams return went perfectly :D GGs!
Anyone at canada cup who can borrow me a ps4 stick :s? Ill pay to use it today + tomorrow +_+
"Been feeling pretty off, haven't been able to focus and just tired. Hopefully its just jetlag, gonna sleeeeep on it"
"armada and n0ne are OUT ""only gonna drink a little"" - armada 2017 dont believe his lies"
what is up with canada cup melee seeding btw lolll
any homie going to Canada cup that can lend me a ps4 stick so I can rob some people in marvel :)?
ucf placebo is the new hip religion
Fat bastard burritos &gt;&gt;&gt; Chipotle
UCF at summit confirmed. Best tournament series
i am awake in the city of Canada hungry much yes
whoever is running twitch presents is probably getting fired huh
oh canada
Landed in Toronto Baby Driver was a fuckin rush WOOO
"Also: my seat was double booked, ended up getting a free first class upgrade and ate the bombest sliders. The flight gods truly are mad"
First time in iceland wooo maybe one day ill be back for something that isn't a layover
"inb4 ""0-3ffen"""
ya boys better make your sugar daddies proud
"i wonder if the people who got 50k spent on them to get to summit, will try half as hard at not going 0-3 as they did campaigning"
its called doubling down if you can't beef over twitter than whats the point
hbox killing melee gets me out of bed in the morning see you at summit bitch.
chudat vs m2k in the year 2017:
Midset warmups and coaching Stay classy
japan trip booked 12th - 23rd december first real vacation in a long time time to work my ass off until then :)
gonna do some serious grinding on netplay streaming but no mic/cam for the most part lets win summit.
irl streaming and filming after parties are definitely just the new paparazzi
its making me feel like a kid reading early bleach/naruto again
dude my hero academia somehow keeps getting better and better lets fucking GOOO
"whether its through labbing the matchup more, finding a FD CP, or picking another matchup entirely, you are always responsible for your loss"
to be perfectly honest/clear tho knowing more about real life matchup stats is not an excuse to lose/whine.  use the knowledge instead.
Esp considering 2017 stats seem to be very in line with 2016s
"For everyone saying ""hurr durr the sample size is too small"" - is there any matchup that has a better sample size?"
Laziness + the stage is so bad that they're winning most matches anyway so they put focus elsewhere
Marth wins 75 - 25 on FD with only 1 marth that can chaingrab and none that properly SDI and thats maybe not okay?? xd
"I will say tho, after looking at the Marth Fox data, FD might be even worse than I thought. It is shockingly good considering everything"
Long stream Ty for watching :)
UCF AT SUMMIT PLS?
the sellout season may have ended but the summit arc is just beginning melee grind all day
people took my tweet last night about johnny/chu wayyyy too seriously hes just the better player rn and i much prefer his sellout game
"s2j beat chu at the fan service/sellout game didn't actually think he would however, amsa broke the record while staying pure and beautiful"
a vote for @Tempo_S2J is a vote for not getting in thru drawing dicks on your face a vote for s2j is a vote for melee
melee labbing + delayed bday stream hehe &amp; who i will support for summit
DONTE MAIN BTW - delayed bday stream hehe gonna stream some online ranked marvel and some smash later tonight
me and @GARMAKILMA are looking to go to japan (mainly tokyo) during mid december for about 10 days what do we need to know? help us weebs!
Few hours
"sick and tired but im too restless to not do anything, will stream in a few"
"thanks everyone for the birthday wishes! sorry if i cant reply to anyone, legit overwhelmed with the massive increase in birthday wises hehe"
same goes to everyone crying over what others spent their money on. in an ideal world we would all give more to charity but welp
"and if your mad summit ""made"" players go too far selling out - they were always like this, you just didn't know.  everyone has a price."
People who think Summit are unethical because they run a profitable tournament really need a reality check :c
Saw koe no katachi. Story was good but the pacing/overall structure didn't work at all as a movie. Pretty disappointed.
waking up sick on your birthday is some KINDA SHIT
"Pulled a classic ""too tired to move to the bed so i stayed up for 4 more hours for no reason"""
also it is now my birthday 23 huh yay
"also, i like Chu and hes funny &amp; great, but i hope he doesn't make it in. he has gone way too far, hopefully that wont become the new normal"
"on the other hand i definitely feel them, i definitely wouldn't campaign for summit myself in the first place honestly."
"the sellout shitstorm shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, and at this point people already spent A LOT of money on voting you this far -"
"i feel pretty conflicted about ppu/hugs dropping out. i wish they didnt enter in the first place, esp since they've both made it before -"
Man the new blade runner movie was great. Liked it way more than the original.
Wew
Hey man i am quite sorry if I tweeted something offensive I am quite gone
Lol no BM intended Xd
all i do on facebook is unfriend frauds these days
Lit
Night out with the boys Sorry no stream Stay tuned to instagram or someshit instead
;_;
T S M
wait can we use ucf at summit pls
Do you even weeb you bakas
The smash community already spending over $100 000 dollars on smash anime merch with bad translations and inaccurate logos is so funny lmao
Okay guys give me your pitch Why should I vote for you?
"alright, marvel infinte online ranked grind - first time on PS4, lets start the journey to rank #1"
"it will have a not so subtle implication that ""selling your firstborn for personal benefits"" = BAD. teenagers will call it ""SO DARK OMG"""
definitely gonna go talk to the black mirror producers and pitch them an episode based on the hypothetical smash summit 35 voting in 2040
how far will you go? which suit will you wear? what thing will you eat? what will you write on your face? who will you rap about? riveting
"the summit voting is much more enjoyable now, viewed as an battle royale anime i just wish it went harder, where's the gore &amp; fan service ?"
trying to reset my sleep schedule i am miserable
lol these typos
"but hey man im sure competing against someone whos controller has no info of it, that has major bugs, is going to be real fun 20xx meme HEHE"
"hax still not releasing the info he promised bet everyone pay still, for a raffle prize for one that only gets awarded if he gets in lel"
back in sweden just gonna chill the fuck out with some marvel
still waiting on the boxx info we shouldve had 1 year ago lul
anyone in europe wanna play some mvci PC?
RTs appreciated!
"The last episode of the Hjelte series is out! This one is about my loss at EVO, in game identity and more!"
home. time to disconnect for a while and rest up. drama and summit voting is bound to trigger me if I dont so ill see you at my stream
dude my hatred is peaking
where were you guys then these past months LOL (obv not literally everyone who uses reddit hates me)
"wish i couldve had more time to sign and take pictures with people, was really busy with how bad the schedule was :("
big shoutouts to all the fans who i met and cheered me on. makes me realize not everyone is a redditor :)
gonna do the hard thing and not post drama See me in my autobiography.
Actually the people who record the after party are going to a special place
Where is the fucking yung lean at this party
15 hour+ work day WOOOOOO time to get wasted with the sad boys When will tournaments start paying overtime prize money Kappa
Xd
l3ffen
"Hopefully I made it a little easier being a leffen fan at least :)  Anyway I'm exhausted (had to wake up at 7am) and salty, so pce for now!"
"Obviously really sad, let the people down but still, this tournament definitely also gave me lots of things to be happy about as well."
"Damn, couldn't keep it going.  GGs to Hbox and Plup! Hoping for a good grand final :)"
Trying my absolute hardest to not complain =_= gonna save it all for a stream when I get home :(
Fuck yes
"Had pretty close sets vs both Ghatzu and Junebug, good shit to both!  I'm playing a bit shaky but staying in there mentally!"
The only people who despise 10AM final brackets more than the players are the spectators apparantly
Any falcons who can help me warm up? By the stream setups
let's dance
Good night. Let's get it tomorrow.
Is first match in winners Bo5 tomorrow?
Upset house
GINGERRR
Wtf is happening
"Damn what a stressful set, rocky played amazing game one and I barely managed to turn the momentum around! GGs, done for the day!"
hype
i am incredibily tired
what was the payout for crews and pot size??
Melee is so fun
"Awww, close but no cigar!  GGs everyone and wp teammates"
I really wanna talk about this schedule but I'll save it until after the tournament so I can explain properly. I feel bad for my crewmates:(
going with the avalanche y o l o
going to tell m2k to play puff on dreamland
wew we made it to crews gf. let's see if we can cause the massive upset!
doing signings/selfies today!  there's no vip room so please don't bother me when i'm playing tomorrow :)
13
What wave of crews does europe play in..?
god damn @SonicFox5000
excited.
"after a couple of days of playing smash and complaining about everyone complaining about fox all day, i feel very ready for Big House."
Chipotles queso s u c c s
A sad story told in 3 pictures
focusing on melee is nice gotta keep grinding.
"whether or not i am initially to blame for this vicious hate is debatable to a degree, but my decision to get away from it is clear as day."
flight was nice. played with amsa and amsah. lol!
"safe to say i got a lot to learn and hopefully ill be able to deal with the hatred, warranted or not, someday. But for now i am fucking done"
"read responses to me losing in tournament, getting sick at smashcon, me not entering genesis red vs armadas/ppu doing the same."
me no longer being open on social media is not some knee jerk reaction because of the hate i got from being salty at mdz. it's goes way back
you have to be a special kind of retarded to not realize how unwarranted the metric tons of hate I got/get from shine tos fucking up is
apparantly they think i think im perfect and did nothing bad but also think everything twitter/reddit says is throughly warranted
one look at reddit with free plane wifi and boy do they love to assume the worst in people. literally zero empathy. Lmao.
had a very productive meeting today. excited to make some real changes.
"as an end note thanks to all the homies, always helping me to chillout &amp; deal with it all. i need to talk to you guys more lmao."
"im sure ill be back eventually, but for now i need a break from being a personality in order to focus on being and improving me."
i will still go to tournaments. ill still use twitter occasionally. but no more sharing personal opinions and being honest about my feelings
until things hopefully get better.  its getting in the way of both my performance and my mental well being and that is not acceptable.
"i really can't justify it at this point. not exactly sure what i'll do, streaming/youtube is more manageable, the rest will have to go-"
when the amount of positive response is so drowned out by hate &amp; by people cheering when you fail at what you give everything to succeed at-
its insane how toxic my daily internet experience has gotten. i know its often a loud minority but i really do think its not worth it atm.
"me being salty and blunt obviously doesn't help me, but even in scenarios where i'm innocent (UCF replay) or ""you didnt win the tournament""-"
"dealing with large amounts of toxicity online is damn hard. shit has me up at night. gotta make a change, can't stand it like this."
i may currently be shit at smash but at least im number one in icons LuL
america is a dangerous place these days :/
"GTX was a cool event outside of the badly ran brackets, coolest venue, hopefully there's another one! Salt lake city is sick."
"that said, time to rebuild and move on. work harder, exercise &amp; eat healthier, use twitter less, study more, go to less mdz ran events ;)"
compared to that scenario everyone laughing at my failures and calling complaints about badly ran tournaments johns seems like a funny joke.
woke up from an absolutely awful nightmare and it was so horrifying that it put things into perspective and made me feel better. lol.
"Anyway second attempt to pce out lmao, im terrible at dealing with this shit"
"Anyway getting off twitter for the forseeable future because my timeline/mentions is a cesspool. Fuck you haters, I'll show you all."
"Definitely not going to an event ran by mattdotzeb again. Shine with all its flaws could've been unlucky, but two trash events in a row?"
"Got so many things to say about this event but I'll save them until a time when I'm less salty. Really, really badly ran bracket"
"Welp, played like absolute trash again. Played better after my set with Lovage but ran out of energy eventually. GGs Plup"
Playing Plup/Syrox/Sfat next for 13th. Wew
Though I'd be lying if I said I wasn't incredibly upset with myself lmao I'll never hear the end of this one I'm sure.
Not really sure why everything has been going to shit recently but I'm not letting this stop me. I still got a chance in losers.
"GGs lovage. Prob the worst ive ever played lmfao, losers next i guess"
So many good matches played in Bo3 despite tons of time and setups...
When does best of 5 start?
"DQ me from marvel pls, too hungry &amp; no stick +_+"
Everything leading up to tomorrow has me feeling pretty confused. Feels like it could be my best tournament or my worst. I'll sleep on it.
Crazy doubles set
Do you need ID to checkin for gtx
A night to remember for sure
Me and @G2Westballz are homies now Ill retweet him oncein a while too

I was on live TV  @FOXLA  Fun times!
anyone in socal wanna netplay
i feel as a fox main i should probably own some shine gear but my wardrobe is full
long day
"melee is so fun got a lot of ideas on how to get good again, can't wait to keep working on it"
anyone wanna netplay yo
"go into any melee stream, scroll up, instant gold sup @khadeezy LMFAO"
My side of the Replay / UCF drama Just wanted to clear up some misconception on what happened
just straight good melee stream no drama pls
does FM 5.7 lag for anyone else
anyone in socal wanna netplay
alright time to clear things up UCF drama etc
"my side of the UCF/Replay drama + burnout/stress  gonna live stream+record it, starting in 5 minutes"
"""home"" in LA thank god i am so tired"
Gonna try to make a video today or tomorrow on the ucf situation. So many misconceptions atm
"Leaving for LA, pce Boston, fun (crazy) tournament, amazing food.  I'll be back."
Anyone at the yotel still playing melee
Melee is scripted
Gonna get off social media for a while. Getting hated and attacked because the TOs fucked up is real triggering. Cya all later.
"Happy my work vs Marth is showing tho, just wish FD didn't exist LMAO. Gotta figure out a solution for sure"
"Bleh, fun set, wish I had kept calm all the way through. Gotta work on closing games for sure. GGs Plup, M2K and Chu.  I'll get ya next time"
Damn shame. Chu is an amazing player with amazing sportsmanship. I would've been crushed if I lost that way.
My mindsets fucked but I'll try to do my best anyway. Hope this is a wakeup call for TOs to properly set up their shit.
Set is apparantly being replayed after the two winners sets. Shitty fucking situation :(
I asked for a button check after G4 specifically because something felt off. This is not just post loss salt
UCF wasnt on I hear? Imo should be replayed??
"GGs Chudat, gl further."
Any ics wanna help ya boi @NintendudeSSB @dizzkidboogie
i just wanna win shine and get a lobster roll today ya feel
Believe it or not. They are now gentlemenning to neutral start (twice) after having neutral ports
Mew2King wins game 4 after planking LOL
"10ish minute break now, trying to get TOs. Lmfao"
"Mew2King down 2-1, now he wants to start chaingrabbing (prev agreed to gentlemens no cgs). Wew"
He had not even won vs Trif yet at that point lmfao. Also got no warning before they made me go play Plup =_=
"The people running the stream matches btw... Sorry but you're doing such a terrible freaking job. They said ""you to go play PPU RIGHT NOW"" üòÇ"
Loser's leffen ain't what he used to be.
"Keep getting caught up in my own head, gotta stop choking man"
Fml lmao
Any falcons wanna help me warm up :)?
Made it thru second round pools Gotta step it up man

GGs to m2k mango Wish I couldve played better

On UCF whats the highest shield drop value?

i love the yotel tho
Doing a meet &amp; greet at the Geico booth at 2:30PM! Busy weekend so this is your one chance to collect Big Leff in your pokedex :v
"Definitely overcompensated because of my Visa issues last year, as well as spring being slow. Hope I feel more motivated tomorrow!"
"Obv still gonna try my best, but I really don't want melee to just feel like work and something I'm obligated to do, and it kinda is atm :/"
"Feeling really burnt out and unmotivated for shine :( definitely not worth it to go to too many events, I'm really stupid."
Gotta go to sleep early for early doubles pools  FeelsBadMan
They said if I finished this bowl I would acheive all of my dreams So I did. Fox - Marth will become even now
Btw if any top players actually wants to discuss the fox marth matchup im down. i doubt it tho
My follow up to the Marth Fox video is up! Ft. Stupid fucking comments
It was amaaaaazing
Let's see
going out to get a 35 dollar lobster roll wish me luck

There's no asian food at this airport  I'm cursed
Craving some asian food damn
Wew
yung LEAN
"Big shoutouts to the community and the team for making it sick. I really hope there's another one, love y'all"
"Real talk tho, I only get 24hrs at home after Heir before I go off to Shine/RB gods and gatekeepers, but man Heir is fucking easily worth it"
This contained 1.2 litres of beer before I 5-0d it
My toughest opponent
"Yeeeee boi. Played way cleaner in GFs, still got a lot to work on in that matchup tho, esp in PAL!  GGs everyone, lots of fun matches :)"
Gotta recharge before grands. Hyped for another set
"This amount of heat and that scary of a set, god damn I was sweating so much.  In GF, winners side!"
Trif is scaryyy. i gotta play better in WFs!
"Top 8 starting soon The venue is so hot, had to go change Sorry @TeamSoloMid my jersey is too warm :("
"Well either way, gotta focus on what I all can do - play some clean melee"
I really don't get how its SO HARD to do dead obvious seeding right.
"In top 8. Playing Trif or Amsah, apparantly they changed the seeding to be good and then changed it back during bracket. Great."
Gotta play cleaaanerrrr
Bracket time Let's see
Misery business now #punkisnotdead etc
I tried to take it easy I promise
Rock City
"Bracket tomorrow, should go to bed early but man its the last Heir I'll try to take it ez tho"
Armada MVP
"Played pretty well, ggs usa. Matches were you're pretty much guaranteed a win is p boring tbh"
Zaik cant believe he wanted him to sign it too #squadplayerprivilege
ill try to irl stream some today i think
Did they fix heir seeding or is it still bad
Woke up in time for pools
Heir man
Will sign controllers and take a selfie in exchange for a bluetooth speaker Call today and I'll add eye contact ($500 value) for free!
"Being peer pressured into playing Crews, feelsbadman"
"hoping heir will be fun tho, looking forward to hanging out with the euro boys"
leaving for Heir now. my life is an absolute mess.  someone remind me to never travel this much again.
whats the best way to get from Stockholm to Heir what airport do i fly to xd
can you still find housing/hotels/room for heir? i forgot to book any LOL @TeamHeir
ill deal with it later
you know times are stressful when leffen doesn't have time for his hair
rant stream was fun  might do again sorry to everyone who experienced my fury
my two new nail polish creations (fox loses vs marth) 4-6  And Sadface 2.0 (now with notches)
"okay going live now RANT DAY answering comments on marth fox, smashcon being bad tournament, controllers etc"
Stream in 10
my youtube editor is on vacation so if you wanna see it then ya better tune in
"prob gonna do a ""looking through marth-fox responses"" and general rant stream today, feeling like screaming into a microphone for an hour"
i miss the good old times when leffen doesnt afraid of anything and got banned
"ah yes, the magical time where leffen was okay with shit seeding"
Heir with that biased seeding lmaooo
itll be damn nice when UCF is the standard :d
degening and choosing controllers + spares for heir -_-
im sorry that im also a human being with opinions dont worry ill block you and let you go back to your little bubble tho
feels like trump just gets more and more absurd
gonna make a follow up video on the marth one just reading youtube/twitter/reddit comments who obviously didnt even watch the vid LOL
New YT Vid! Another Marth (and Fox) rant :v Leme know what you think!
"Back in Sweeeeden. No time to rest tho, this is basically just a long layover until Heir, so back to work it is =_="
Finally boarding last flight home after 7 hour layover Let me get homeeeeee
Catch my stream tomorrow Tbh tho just read thru twitter/reddit lol
Smash con was such a badly run tournament but a good Con. Hope next one is better :(
Still could've been better prepared of course but yeah i'm not gonna be too hard on myself for this one. Hopefully I used up all my bad luck
Insane that I was able to do as well as I did in retrospect.  Gonna have to get more notched backups for next time (assumed theyd be banned)
"Legit thought it was just me not being used to it, but nah, apparantly it cannot dash dance and the x and cstick button don't register 1/10"
"On the flight home, checking out the spare controller I was forced to use... Jeeeeeeeesus this controller is shit I'll cya all at Shine LOL"
currently waiting for uber prices to go down lmao 470 dollar uber back to the hotel  x_x
"only saw 2 sets at moonrise but still really, really satisfied. thanks- @porterrobinson @PrettyLights"
Gz teammate @C9Mang0
Hope we get a great GF
pLUp
Leaving for moonrise soon if any more wanna tag along
gl to everyone competing today. hope to see some great smash
"my stomach still hurts but while i cant play thru it, it doesnt get better laying down (worse) and this hotel wifi is straight torture soo"
anyone still selling Moonrise tickets btw? heard some shit went down yday. we are 2 trying to go (if anyone else wants to tag along hmu)
gonna try to grab a setup early today and do a meet n greet / bo3 since I didn't do any yday! stay tuned
woke up feeling a bit better (that makes me a lil mad)  can't wait for the next tournament :)
"gonna try to sleep now, gn everyone"
"going to heir next weekend already, going to try my best to recharge for that one. ill be back."
"thanks for all the support, really helps. trust me im more upset than anyone that this happened :'( I really appreciate it &lt;3"
big shoutouts to my boy @hrcTypo for trying everything to fix up my broken controller LOL sad we didn't plan for a notched backup =/
"Again, if anyone who subbed for the smashcon goal wants a resub email me at l3ff3n@gmail.com Sorry once more"
I tried my hardest despite everything but I'm completely out of it. I understand if everyones mad but I'm proud of myself. I tried :(
"I fortfeit out of losers as well. In too much pain,controller etc. They also told me I'd have to play my match right away lol Sorry everyone"
"Ah man, close set. GGs plupper, finally broke that game 5 PS curse  :)"
"Using a shitty replacement, trying to get used to it before my match. Might go marth idk"
Update to the best day ever: Controllers cstick completely broke 5 mins before I was supposed to play Plup. god fucking damnit.
Just really sad tbh
Gonna try to see if I can perform a miracle or something against Plup in WQ. Send your energy boys.
"Feeling very bad, my body definitely wants me out but I feel like I owe it to the subs and everyone I've beaten to try, at least in winners."
Beat Pewpewu 3-1 solidly but sloppy lol. Anyone know when I play my next match?
"Beat 42nd and llod 2-0 tho, but losing 3-0 to food poisoning :("
The TV got suuuuper blurry during game 2 of me and LLod. Don't play on stream until they switch it or blame yourself
:(
When does bo5 start
"still feeling like trash, despite trying everything i could. gonna try to play singles anyway =/"
"okay stomach pain not going away, give me your best medication (walmart nearby) please =_= playing at 4, hope i have time"
can I blame taco bell
Woke up with major stomach pain =_= had some yesterday but its much worse now. Hopefully it goes away asap :(
"man smash masters is a cool idea but everything being decided by ""big victories"" is so lame"
Missed all of TI today :( lets go liquid thooo
"I wanna play fox but havent my controller has been under the needle all day Hope I do well tomorrow anyway, no idea what to expect tbh."
"No, I brought 4 good ones. Prepping for the future :)"
If anyone who subbed to me to team with mango ill happily refund u :) (despite me being upfront about it &amp; eventually taking it down)
Sidenote: if someone has a controller with good backdash theyre willing to sell hmu ill pay top $$
My controllers cstick stopped working Typo is on the case but ya if I lose in round one pools now u know why LMAO
Catch me at the geico booth for meet n greet at 3:30! Will be busy all weekend so if u wanna meet big leff this is your chance :d
okay never mind im getting those doritos tacos from taco bell instead
hi anyone seen my teammate
just woke up yeah my sleep schedule is ruiiiined
"if you see me at smashcon, please give me the finger instead of fistbumps"
Gonna checkin shower and head to the venue. Who is trying to play (and eat)?
I'm just chasing the feeling of playing Guitar Hero 2&amp;3 back in the day tbh
Downloaded stepmania to play on flights I will be a true stepmaster after this month Taking investors
i didnt really realize how many are going to smashcon damn
Anything happening at ssc today
Big Leff
Headed to the airport for my first of many flights this month =_= Gonna try my hardest to play well at each event and to not burn out!
in case anyone expected me to be active on social media or streaming - prob not
"honestly tho my schedule is going to be hell the next month or so smashcon heir shine red bull g&amp;gk 4 weekends in a row, 10 or so flights."
so im going to heir (most likely)  just thought id update even tho its not 100% since everyone else is droppin
"European top players, please netplay me to prepare me for the smashcon tournament this weekend! thank you in advance!!"
has someone got their smashbox yet? i wanna buy one and do a review (not legality based)
lets go OG my boys-in-laws
putting the losers on camera and doing losers interview right after they lost is... idk it doesn't feel right
1 day tickets are a 100 something ill pay for the ubers lmao
"anyone else wanna go to Moonrise festival on Sunday after melee top 8? ~1 hour away can prob catch lil uzi vert, porter &amp; pretty lights!"
eu peeps who wanna grind hmu
I've been going to sleep at 10 and waking up at 730 am and man being a normie is depressing
Episode one of my new video series with TSM is out!!
"THE SMASHCON GRIND going ham today, practicing all day"
who in europe wants to grind some netplay today ya boi is trying to get back into shape
havent won a major in a week so reddit hates me again god damnit.
Logan was pretty good
"thank you all for subbing, craziest sub train today =)"
"reached subgoal, going to smashcon teams is unsure w/ new schedule (was told finished on friday) will see"
"the smashcon talk-subgoal, seeding, predictions, prejohns etc also talking about the most overrated players of 2017"
I want to buy me a GOML sweater gdamnit
Going shopping and finding no clothes is depressing man
I wanna 3D print notches

Good Nite

LOUD MUSIC
Half the boys are out cole

Party nite
Smashcon begger - THE BOYSSS X7 @Popopidopop @LAMP_SQ @zaik_ssbm @RoadToFLundberg @yungyabes + Hack
the boys comin over today nice sesh coming to a stream near you
Overall I think the ruleset is a decent starting point and I look forward to more structured debate in the future. I'll talk more on stream.
what a day  im going to sleep. see ya
this is so insanely backwards and stupid i dont even know how to respond to it. Mr Wizard has outdone himself. a true comedian
update: EVO is apparently now allowing coaching everywhere but the stream setup. you can decline to play on stream every match until top 8.
the 30 second rule is just absurd too you couldnt have one judge on stream for top 8 qualifiers but expect to regulate every single match?
evo is now allowing mid set coaching i have a working theory that mr. wizard hates his job/evo and is trying to get fired
see this is what happens when BEAST doesnt pay out
"""leffen i thought you already went to smashcon, BEAST 7 remember?"""
beast LUL lolex LUL
back home  lets play some games
gonna do an IRL stream buying booze for GOML Celebration and lunch?
Smashcon Subgoal + team with mango + GOML celebration/chill   get alcohol subgoal?
is @SuperSmashCon teams reg closed?  me and @C9Mang0 might just team if not
"anyone who thinks any variation of it should be allowed in the official ruleset is either ignorant, retarded, or owns a hax$ dakimakura"
In my opinion they should still be banned as long as they use Analog - Digital Transition in any form (cstick too) but yeah.
"Until they are publicly available, have been properlytested (hbox vs hax) and have ACTUAL description of what it does, there is no debate."
"regardless of if you believe that hitbox style controllers should ultimately be allowed in smash, they should clearly be banned for now -"
"im not one for fidget spinner money grabs but if someone can make one that spells out ""fox might not be the best character"" when it spins..."
jokes on you i lost to two marths #BLESSUP #AMEN
someday i will explain why i complain about fox marth but meanwhile i will enjoy laughing at you all from a higher spiritual level
"my first piece of official merch will be a  ""Marth beats Fox 6-4"" hat/wristband/tshirt/twitter bio"
the devil took control of my twitter account and made me post fake news
i am home and ive awakened from my post tournament/flight hibernation. what did i miss
i wanna go to TI too maaan
"wayhome was an hour away from GOML this weekend, and I think Moonrise Festival is one hour away from Smashcon but I'm busy playing D:"
"i want to go to festival at some point this fall, what do people recommend? (im a scrub when it comes to this :v)"
Probably gonna have to switch wavedashing to L
Short hop wavedashing with fox is so much better and makes waveshining free but its soooo hard for me because of all the muscle memory =_=
general rule of firefox fastfall: For anything angle higher than the up forward/up back corner you should delay your fastfall by 3 frames
"i noticed @PG_Plup catching people offguard with his upforward-&gt; fastfall, seemed quicker than everyone elses which didnt make sense."
WHY HAS NO ONE TOLD ME THAT THE FIREFOX FASTFALL TIMING IS DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON WHAT ANGLE YOU CHOOSE
"i'm pretty sure that almost everyone does not Short hop when they wavedash, even top players. pretty common to see accidental full jumps."
why has no one told me that short hopping with fox makes wavedashing/waveshining significantly more lenient???1+!?
"Leaning towards not going still, registered just in case ‚î¨‚îÄ‚î¨„Éé( ¬∫ _ ¬∫„Éé)"
Flight delayed by 2 hours =(
i would register today and then not go if i dont reach it
ill subgoal it
"New Youtube Vid! Back with more labbing, this time showing various tech for Fox and Peach! What should I lab next?"
"Ey whos close to the airport and wanna chill, flight at 6"
goml two time champ just hanging out and eating tim hortons talking about shit
pretty sure I just left it plugged in @GOML_Smash @TorontoJoe
i actually lost my controller LOL if anyone has seen a black controller with notches (slightly torn cord) pls let me know ;_;
gotta get up real early tomorrow so no partying for me =( I will do a chill hotel celebration stream though :)
FeelsGoodMan
Shoutouts to @PG_Plup for the inspiration btw :)
"I know it sounds corny, but, when I play on point it truly feels like no one can get on level lmaoo"
Feels so damn good to come through and repeat. All my hard work is finally paying off :')
Fuck yes
One more.
Any puffs who can help me warm up? 2saint is here right? Im in the vip
Couldve been a great set :( GGs anyway
I desperately need a falcon player pls come to the vip room :))
Any falcon players wanna warm me up? Pls : D
"None or mafia next to make it into top 8, lets gooooo"
Sleepy
"long day, came out on top and played some good melee :d tomorrow tho."
"Thats better! Pretty happy about me and @LG_ICE s performance, tho we lost some stupid games throughout the tournament. GGs!"
Blehhh
"Pretty exhausted, hopefully just 2 more sets :)"
I wish this included the pikachu matchup too :(
90% of my marth fox tweets were honestly not that serious but this is actually sad LOo
Case in point:
Falgo LOL
After studying the Marth matchup and playing more vs top marths I've realized:  Marth mains suck at melee outside of the Fox/Falgo matchup
"Is GOML reseeding? Its really, really bad now haha @GOML_Smash"
"can't think straight, excited and confused at the same time. hopefully i can sleep well tonight"
"goml closed real early, not tired at all hotel stream maybe?"
"GOML day 1, just crews today tho and I'm not in one :v"
"lots of melee today, gotta keep working hard, I can feel it"
justin bieber took my rooftop  maaan
"Lobster, Calamari and Scallops :]"
My feed is fucking rip
pretty sure doing an ama on twitter by quoting every question should be illegal
I feel like im making serious progress in the marth matchup ty all for the help so far!
whats really holding me back in melee is my age when I get older and stop hearing the high pitched CRT noise i will be unstoppable
why does music sound so much better loud
who in toronto tryna grind today?
i just wanted to tweet because you didnt want me to
hugo is a redditor CONFIRMED
WEW
its almost 8am and I still can't sleep Jetlag :(
gonna live stream soon pissed future falco main live from a hotel room in Toronto
"be marth invincible back dash half screen grab  run forward fsmash sometime mfw i win  ""i have amazing fundamentals"""
I will avenge the Fox players... ...every single Marth main who doesnt Uthrow or SDI and and claims the matchup is even... I will find you
someone take my profile picture and replace my head with falcos thanks
maybe?
wwait falco is just better in every way vs marth actually
im at my hotel  Waiting  Help

i want to make a yt video of the stupid responses to my tweets
tune into dreamhack see fox lose vs marth FeelsBadMan
low level people answering the question with stupid things yay i am real surprised!!
just curious if i'm just missing something because relying on the marth being bad to have a BNB is pretty sad hehe
"imho i think marth has a significant advantage in every big area of the game (avg % per kill, combo, neutral, ease of use, CPs, recovery)"
"so for anyone who plays marth - fox matchup at a high level, what exactly is fox supposed to do in the matchup? im shit &amp; need to learn"
why should I go to smashcon/shine?
"sorry boys but i've always been a player first streamer/content creator second. ill make it worth the wait, i promise :)"

i am too sad to be sober tho if u see me and talk about melee ur getting ignored :d
i have faith ice can carry me tho or i wouldnt bother hopefully i will heal before goml...
"going to try to play teams tomorrow for ice's sake but tbh expecting to play terrible, i am too sad/disappointed and my hearts not in it."
"Good shit @ArmadaUGS , bringing it home for sweden!!"
Thank. God.
Planking is so stupidly good
...quick someone run up and coach
Thank god
Like I thought it would be bad but boy
Just straight depressed at how shitty this EVO is being ran. No developer support and the biggest FGC tournament treats us like a joke.
Lolllll mrwiz never change
"And to everyone who think you're helping by giving me shit tier advice, respectfully, please don't LMAO."
"Extremely upset at myself for how badly I played and how awful my prep for the tournament turned out to be. Pathetic 2017 so far, sry every1"
"Meh, thats unfortunate. Gotta work on that matchup. Fuck Bo3 lmao, ill cya all at GOML"
"The moon next, not sure if off stream"
"Played awful, cant expect to win like this. Losers next, hope I can clean it up!"
whoever is putting matches on stream is doing an awful job of letting people know when theyre gonna play lmao
Bo3+westballz makes for a scary combo! M2K next
Any falcos wanna warm me uppp
"Well I beat Ryan Ford 2-0, done until 4"
"Waited an hour for the stream, and then got told to play off stream. GG"
"Beat Gucci 2-0 and Army 2-0 off stream. Getting into it, up vs Ryan ford on stream in a bit!"
Let's have some fun.
What a top 8
Regardless I'm confident that the rest of the year is gonna be reaaaal good
"Feeling gooood about my play, prep has gone well. Hopefully I can keep it up despite any circumstances during tomorrows bo3 marathon of hell"
I made it out of my pool. Lost 2 stocks total (both JV4) Whens floating LUL
Meet n greet at geico booth then pools at 4 :v
Okay leffen evo tip #1 The chow mein from the Pan asian in the food court by the venue is the most wack thing I've ever tasted. Don't get it
If you wanna catch the Leff for your pokedex snap it today (when im not playing) cuz tomorrow I'll be too busy
Any booths got faust merch leme know
So many booths this year holy
"Day 1 of EVO! Feeling ready, should be relatively easy :)"
"Party was fun, just chilled for a bit then played fox dittos with Ice lmao  DJ was p. good so it was pretty lit still hehe"
Vegas is too hot man
Whatsup Ppl still playing?
Smash 4 being on DisneyXD sounds like a r/kappa post LOL Fucking sick tho congrats
Hugo isnt VIP Has to pay for his drinks One of the Plebs #partyingwithhugs86
So @PG_Plup said he hates Ice's jean shorts. He thinks hes such a baller. I do too
"Moorea Beach Club, bottom floor of Mandalay"
I'm here at the Red Bull party for a bit Pretty poppin Gaming setups etc and I got the yung VIP  Shame I gotta play tomorrow lmao
anyone tryna play &amp; get food?
part of me just wants to take an evo off and chill  seems like an amazing party tournament but well someone has to beat ledge camping :v
the reason why i got a todoroki controller is obviously because he has the ultimate genetics just like me
Ordered this for whenever notches get banned. Todoroki best boi Made by @littleteafox
The points were not even updated before the event.  Punishing the 3 teams that stuck together and did well is a straight terrible system.
If Dizz/Colbol performed better at Genesis Red and S2j/shroomed performed worse then 1-3 seeds wouldve played the 3 hardest teams.
Hopefully Fuse isn't seeded based on points. Standard seeding or top seeds picking opponent would make much more sense.
Hooked up by @redbullesports (Ôø£Ô∏∂Ôø£)
fun first day in vegas feeling pretty ready tbh
New youtube vid! Some sick netplay vs @Tempo_S2J ! Leme know what you think about the new overlay

Why I and other top players didn't enter Genesis Red &amp; my Summer Schedule.  Read:
I actually thought for some reason that Reddit wouldn't be insanely stupid for once but yeah that was a mistake lmao
"Not entering Singles, sorry! Hope you guys understand."
Btw my gamecube cord is tearing a lil. If it stops working can u replace it?
"(said this before on stream, just thought I put it on twitter. Leaning towards not entering but I'll see how well I sleep)"
"Might not enter singles tomorrow depending on how tired I feel tomorrow. Playing doubles either way, just wanna make sure I'm rested for EVO"
"Arrived in San Jose, staying by the convention center. G4 Vibes"
Omw to Norcal! Soooo tired.
"flying to norcal tomorrow at 1PM, how early should I arrive :o (LAX)"

if evo doesnt adapt then im sure other events will take its place so i'm not too worried either way
tbh i want nothing else but evo 2017 to be an amazing event that makes everyone wanna go to 2018 but i'm not holding my breath.
evos reg number are super disappointing but also not surprising.  hope this huge drop acts as a wake up call.
In hindsight maybe it's actually more normie to have an anime profile pic than to look like you're from one

fine saturday chillin
should i stream now
My AMA from earlier this week is out! Answering some spicy questions
Is there anything better than free ice cream („Å£¬¥‚ñΩ`)„Å£
Little has indeed changed.
"(anything 1 exact angle is impossible to do consistently on a normal controller because of how melees coding works, including 1.0 dash)"
This works for all tilts/smashes you can angle down/up  and btw the current hax mem card angles make doing the 2 angle specific ones trivial
!grind stream melee and music
grind stream?
just look at peach/samus players if you need proof that this is going to happen again.
honestly tho i fully expect sheik mains to not learn whats given to them and continue whining about their recovery thats just how it is.
reddit shitters triggered me again heres some further explanation on the Sheik recovery + babyrage
Doing a live AMA on Twitch! ask me random shit yo
I hope one day the floatie mains go in to the lab and give me fox tech and pay us hard working lab monsters back
The tech I was talking about last week! The New and Optimal sheik recovery?`
evo training arc + new hacks? trying out the new controller codes
thank you for watching =)
i am fine loll
wholesome streamer talking dreamhack evo and not about other things
ughhhhhhhh well my stream today is going to be happy and wholesome as fk melee only no shittery
"Either way I don't want to be too involved, but I honestly hope we as a community come together and make a decision."
"It'd be different if he was asking what he could do to make things right, instead of being a bigot on facebook and calling people liars lmao"
"I don't think the answer is to permanently ban him forever, but he has done nothing to prove hes changed and is lying his ass off."
"How now the community thinks we are discriminating and witch hunting someone who repeatedly done far, far worse things over several years."
As someone who was banned for a year based on smashboard posts without a second chance or even talked to in person it is truly absurd to see
i'm streaming tonight tell all your friends
My baiken is going to destroy poor @garmakilma s faust here on stream
EVO numbers falling is not a surprise after how they treat smash (2nd/3rd biggest) along with SFV being SFV.  You gotta keep up.
woke up feeling real shitty  post tournament cold i think god damnit
Me
"Headed home from Dreamhack! Had an awesome time hanging out with everyone, see you next time!"
people still playing smash at DH today? anyone tryna practice
the fucking Boyyyyyys
Dunno what my next tournament is but EVO practice starts tomorrow!
Considered dropping out friday but I'm proud that I didn't. Despite rust I had some sick games and my mentality still feels great from SnS.
"Ah shit, ran outta juice and started dropping everything. Not too salty tho, did what I could with I had. I'll come back stronger!"
Also it is soo hot i am sweating like a pig
Aw thats a real bummer. Loser finals next!
"Bleh, thats what I get for not practicing properly. GGs, WF next, lets clean it up"
Top 8 starting soon! Lets fucking do this
Made it to top 8 winners side by beating Android 3-0. Gameplay was pretty sloppy but pulled through with mindset.
Sadboys teamkill :(
Ledge camping and mid set coaching? What a surprise. When is the community going to realize that we are hurting our game with shit rulesets?
Just woke up what did I misd
"Dreamhack summers are always so chill, fun times."
Going to bed earlyish  The boys will have to party for me Gl
Of all the players to throw away true combos for tech chasing...
Shroomed forward/down throwing with marth to tech chase spacies instead of uthrow comboing is one of the worlds greatest mysteries.
Are there any lit clubs in j√∂nk√∂ping lmao

please jigglypuff mains be careful with your popoffs do not do this at home
NEW JIGGLYPUFF TECH  Wins TSM LEFFEN EVO (Gone sexuaLLLL)
"leffens lab Back with more fresh melee tech - Sheik Recovery, New Shield Push off tech &amp; more"
why dont people do this recovery lol
after 10 minutes of labbing i have now found a practical sheik UP B recovery that you cant cover with ledge standup (you have to guess)
disproving 2 of backdash myths as a response to @spark_ssbm @brtarolg blaming controllers for their awful execution
i made a vid disproving this myth
I will say that while the games look neat I just hope they aren't afraid to offer the depth and difficulty BOTW did.  Wii era sucked at that
"Breath of the wild has restored my faith in Nintendo, hyped for metroid/mario/yoshi/kirby/pokemon for the switch!"
capcom just makes me mad
So many misconceptions around it.
"Also I honestly think dashback is so incredibly blown out of proportion. There's a reason its only a big deal now, 15 yrs into the game."
Memory card mod &gt;&gt;&gt; arduinos
actually too tired  gonna nap until sony e3 instead stream tomorroww
"anyway, done twitter ranting. Going to do a lab stream in an hour or so, every good player who wants to help are very welcome."
"also please note that even with a LGL, going to the edge is still incredibly strong, it just doesn't let you do it for 8 minutes straight."
"Jiggs is a really easy char to pickup if youre already good, low maintenance and most people have never even been planked before. Why not?"
If the community does decide against a ledge grab limit I'll be picking up jigglypuff as a secondary to camp me into top 8s lmao
"And don't give me ""uhh but wobbling"" ""well laser limit lolz"" those are separate issues, and a different discussion entirely."
Who would lose from a LGL? -The few people who hang on the edge for 8 minutes straight  -those who enjoy watching paint dry
Who would benefit from a LGL? -TOs (timeout galore) -Majority of viewers -Players (who enjoys planking or playing against it?) -Sponsors
and how likely is it that its not the optimal strategy in any relevant matchups?
"EVEN IF we find a clear cut solution, something that magically appears and removes any incentive to do it, our scene might already be dead."
Are we gonna spend the next years with top 8s centered around ledge camping or trying to fight against it and hope we eventually solve it?
"A ledge grab limit helps because it limits meaningful interaction in most matchups, and even the answers are usually degenerate as well."
"The main reason we ban Temple, Rainbow cruise or Great Bay is NOT because they're imbalanced and one character is unbeatable on them."
Repeat this with me: the point of a ledge grab limit is NOT to balance the game or to nerf Jigglypuff or any other character.
"So far, from playing the top player netplay group, the answer seems to be  ""get 4 stocked and ragequit"""
its hilarious seeing people who have never played against it or tried to lab it say that everyone just needs to find a magical answer to it.
im genuinely interested in how good players deal with it (not random redditors/m2k+hbox subs) who don't think a LGL helps our scene.
if any europeans who aren't in favor of a LGL wanna netplay letsgo show me how to beat it please because I don't see it
been ledgecamping people on netplay as Puff for the last couple of hours I feel like my soul is dying perfect for my upcoming m2k/hbox sets!
i feel like the average redditor would instantly flip flop their opinion about a LGL if Hbox planked any other char than fox lmao
after a quick lab i found several really stupid ledge camping techniques and no I'm seriously conflicted if I should share them &gt;_&gt;
The risk reward for ledge camping in many matchups when you are at high% them at low% is ridiculous atm and I don't know how it'd be solved.
"All that said, counter ledge camping meta obviously still has ways to go, but so does the ledge camping meta.  A real solution isn't likely."
"Since TOs/streamers want a top 8 that both finishes on time and relies on viewer # to host the event, I wouldn't be surprised if they ban it"
"Its just my opinion, but what most people considers entertaining to watch and play against does matter. You're not a scrub for disliking it."
"To be real, ledge camping is legal for now, but for TOs that dont act and the players who abuse it know that you're hurting the melee scene."
"Just woke up. Had a terrible dream, that top level melee has devolved into ledge camping and everyone refused to change the ruleset."
im gonna leave this as is

anyone in sweden/going to DH summer that can do arduino mods btw? I wanna try it out asap :)
"Gonna sleep, ill cya later world"
Cheating (intentional and unintentional) and standardizing/not splitting community are a huge problem with no clear solution tbh
"Saying that ""cheating would be obvious"" when half the top players don't know what a smash turn is 15 years into the game is straight comedy"
"oh and also, if TOs are not smart enough to ban arduinos until a more informed verdict is out I am not going to attend that tournament haha"
"(obviously it might also be right, but this is the type of responses that should not be upvoted lmao)"
"This info is not peer reviewed and has a BIG bias behind it, view it like a Cigarette company funded research - with Skepticism."
"Keep in mind however, please realize where Hax is coming from.  Regardless of how honest you see him, his career depends on this being legal"
"The community as a whole, and esp TO's need to get involved. This is a good conversation starter and lets a lot more people test around."

Yung leff ‚úà Big leff
crazy wf
outclassed
"im suuuuper excited though, can't wait to move forward."
It really sucks dealing with a terrible practice environment when you're in a slump but I gotta focus on the things I can change for now
I also just need to accept that living in Sweden will mean that for the majority of the events I simply won't be as practiced as I'd want.
Deliberately haven't practiced as much as I would usually want in order to focus on my mindset and playing less tense and less predictably.
"leaving for smash n splash in 5 hours, its gonna be a really pivotal tournament for me I think."
"lffnMewtwo(man) now live, along with all the other emotes!"

ive been focusing on all the wrong things and kinda lost my own ideal playstyle in the process but ah I finally see clearly again
"The smash and splash grind begins for real! On todays menu, Platforms &amp; punishes!"
"It's a really long vid, but let me know what you think, I'm still pretty new to this controller. RTs appreciated as well ;)"
Multi notched controller showcase! If this doesn't get banned (it really should imo) then this will be a must buy.
Showcase vid coming out soon. Get ready to place your orders before everyones queue fills up ;)

fox player friday night practiiiiceeeeeeeee
"Netplay tournament is back on tomorrow! Starts at 4, tournament link in the netplay EU group :)"

SEE ME IN MELEE YOU FUCKS

Anyone else at philly airporttt
Day one of Smash N splash grind.
"My and Ice's shuttle leaves at 2PM, anyone got setups and down to play until then?"
After a lot of shitty greasy american food my sadness is while still there temporarily deafened Oh thats why
It was sloppy  Armada played off I still got 5th But damnit if it didn't make me feel just a little bit better. Congrats mango
Legendary set

Sucks to work so hard and end up a complete failure maaaan what a sad day
First step is giving away my conttoller lmfao
Gotta make some huge lifechanges moving forward. I can't stand being this FUCKING SHIT
"Got really tilted when my shield drops wouldnt work and couldnt bring it back in G3! Good shit dfox though, I got ran over."
"GGs. Yet another huge dissappointment. I'm not worthy of your support, but thank you all anyway."
"Good set, sad I'm still so inconsistent but when everything clicks I know I can do it. Losers vs Dfox next!"
"I did my best, can't do anything more.  On to singles."
Hardest set left. Lets finish it.
Does teams start at 4?
"I order steak n eggs for breakfast, rare steak. Ice goes: I'd like the same, but the steak well done.  We're not winning teams are we"
Any puffs who wanna play LMAO
Game day
Hax fucking money LUL
Meh played shaky after I got a lead again :(
"Dissappointed in the reoccuring bad habit, but also happy my peaks are really good. GGs! Qualified for top 8 winners."
Crush bringing hope to a new generation
"Playing @Shroomed08 next, in an hour or so, to make it into top 8!  Practiced a lot vs ICs and managed to dodge both lmaoo"
Lmao thats one way to start the day  Lessgooo cactuar
Oh and any ics players who wanna play/MM pleeeeeeaaaase hit me up

Another WF for muffen
"Me and @LG_ICE beat Cactuar&amp;Reno and Crush&amp;Slox to qualify for bracket in 2 hours. Playing alright, no dropped games but some close calls!"
"This happened at lan ets as well, I def gotta learn the setups before playing Dizz/Chu!"
"Done with my pool! Lost a game in WF haha, got wobbled at sub 30 4 times +_+ Other two games were JV4s tho"
Where in the hotel is the venue lmao
Driving to atlantic cityyyy Feeling goodddd
"I tried alerted the TOs earlier but was ignored. I really dislike subjectively deciding ""this has happened more than I want"" at supermajors."
One of which they played when mango had already lost twice. The one other time (dhaustin) was in winner semis and because of armada dq...
Am I the only one who thinks reseeding to avoid Mango vs Chudat in WQ is ridiculous? Out of their last 3 sets 2 were invitationals -
Playing some @SuperSensoGame during bootcamp breaks. I need help to find ways to beat rangers+warp :v   #how2senso #ad
"New YT vid! Now with hopefully less controversy :) Talking some about hand problems, netplaying with mango &amp; more!"
Gonna make sure to talk to my editor to make sure it doesn't happen again.
Some other things were just weird out of context/in a highlight vid and just made me look like a douche lmao
"I think smash commentary needs improvement, more so in some areas than others, but I really don't think its bad in general."
Just landed. Privated the clickbait vid on my channel. Was just a bad video that both clickbaited and misrepresented me imo. Sorry!
On my way to royal flush :D Let's shred some floaties
Played much cleaner in GFs! Had a really nice mindset realization that worked out. Definitely gotta attend weeklies more again
"Still got another set in GFs, gotta clean it up"
"Man im playing so fucking awful in tournament still. Happy I came to the weekly, gonna try to work on my mindset asap"

home and awake with a decent sleep schedule royal flush bootcamp starts today ashamed of my performance so far in 2017 ._.
I am still looking to buy rare gamecube controllers btw Gundam(!)/symphonic green/club nintendo mostly! All clear/panasonic for a good price
8 hour flight to frankfurt now zzz Then 6 more hours to get home ZZZZZ Time to grind tech skill I guess
"A high ledgegrab limit (40ish) for timeouts would be a good, non disruptive rule imo"
Being forced to switch flights Arriving 12 hours later with an extra layover 24+ straight hours of travel Feeling like chudat game 5
More Delays WOOO united
Anyone at the austin airport tryna fiend some melee
Flight delayed prob missing my layover welLl
At the airport on my way back to sweden. DH was a great event but thats the past. Royal Flush grind - day 1
Man I have lost far too many tournaments Gonna drop everything else and fucking no life melee for the rest of the year
Actually anyone by the hilton wanna play melee Im fiending
Can't get into twitch party either Im actually invited But no ID on me LMAO
Whats happening in austinnn
When u sd so hard you lose another placement
And we never saw Mew2Kings peach ever again
anybody wanna grind some melee would prefer it over watching top 8 tbh
"mew2king playing good today, been picking up the pace"
Green fox now I think its intentional
As much as I want plupper to win Everyone who picks blue sheik over neutral sheik deserves whatever happens
"#1 no matter if you play better fundamentals 90% of the time, if you sd/fuck up/fall for cheese 5% of the time you'll lose in the end."
Altho I got dunked on I still learned many valuable lessons that will be needed during the upcoming majors.
"All in all I'm still proud of myself for trying, I'll explain more after the tournament but normally I would never have entered."
"The end result was obviously awful, couldve been better if I got a bit of momentum but eh. Next time this happens ill play simpler instead."
"same problem all weekend, I just had to focus way more than usual to play decent fundamentals and so I slipped up and threw at key moments"
"Its a terrible feeling to lose to yourself mentally, even worse to lose to your own physical body.  I have to take better care I guess."
Did my best to play well this weekend but I just couldnt overcome it. My heart was in it but my gameplat wasnt GGs to Mew2King and Mango.
Need a marth main asap :( Got a setup by station 1
Any marth player who wanna warm this big leff up
Slept really badly buy whatever letsgOOOoo
people still at the venue playing?
I think I'll play more clean tomorrow after today's practice and a good nights sleep :d
"i wont be sick before next tournament etc, but for now im gonna try my best to make a sick ass losers run"
"pretty happy i made top 8 after everything that happened, even if its through losers. Can't expect to win on point mango with this rust."
cant even uthrow fh uair Fundamentals got me tho Made top 8 losers side
Threw my advantages super hard Gotta stop that hehe Next match in losers vs Sfat
Playing like trash GEGe
"Beat Crush pretty solidly 3-0, but I gotta play a lot better if I wanna beat Mango"
"Made it out of pools in winners. Played pretty on point but a lot of tech skill flubs. Lost 3 stocks total, shouldve been 0."
Stupid tech skill misses Fuck
"nothing against armada, ive said this for a long time. honestly inexcusable unless it breaks the day off, hopefully it doesn't happen again."
caring a lot about your controller yet not having a spare ???
are pools delayed? when does wave C start
"today was really fun, especially nice considering how trash my previous week has been. super hyped to compete again"
Anyone trying to play for a bit Got a setup at the hilton
Funniest day in a while 10/10 Would drop mango again

ROFL @HugS86 @tafokints @htcesports
"A lot of stupid shit on my mind, ill let u guys know after the tournament.  For now all I'm focusing on is doing my best with what I got."
Good fundamentals but bad tech skill today
How much of singles is played on saturday for dreamhack austin?

"Got a ride thru one if the apps from the airport, thanks for the help/offers"
"Finally landed in Austin, with less ear pain.  Still gotta get to the hotel ‚Üí_‚Üí"
I've always wanted to see how I'd fair in a battle royale
The delayed united flight just got announced as being overbooked and people are furious lmao
Another delay thanks United
Had such a terrible week and traveling with this shit is just the cherry on top. Sick+stressed+Worst pain in years+delayed flight =GG
Anyone who has experienced this and does it get worse if I fly again?
"Legit in so much pain, still got another flight and I've tried all the standard shit and nothing works"
"Having really sharp pain in my right eardrum 2 hours after landing, hope it goes away, seems like I may have an ear infection -_-"
(assuming im still not sick by the tournament)
"Omw to DH Austin. Still sick and tired/stressed and as a result far more rusty and worse prepared than I'd like. Fuck it, gonna win anyway."
i have SIX more twitch emote slots what do
"stream starting now! new stream setup, new 20XX, recapping my Cali trip &amp; plans for DH Austin!"
"NEW VIDEO! recap of Coachella, what truly makes you happy, streamed from socal at the @redbullesports hq :)"

c a l l e d i t
and yes this includes terribly edited top 10s too
"not gonna flag any past videos but if any more of the low effort smash ""content creators"" use my shit ill flag if you dont even ask. thanks."
"shigatsu was occasionally amazing but too inconsistent and badly structured at times. enjoyed it thoroughly, esp as a fan of classical music"
"watched some anime  shigatsu wa kimi no uso : a great, well produced anime with flaws. boku no hero: distilled shonen. entertaining."
Stealing content Xd
I have arrived in sweden Yung leff did not get any sleep Yung leff is sick and is having a rough time :(

"asking for neutral start = ""i care about a tiny position difference at the cost of cheating &amp; changing timings but i cant remember 3 ports"""
"""hopefully both people both manage to stand pixel perfectly neutrally and move on the same frame""  OR SPEND 2 SECONDS LEARNING THE 3 PORTS"
"""hey lets wait 5 seconds every single game to set up some kinda neutral position  thats screws over randall/wispy/PS/fod then kinda start"""
neutral start remaining the most stupid thing since KJ64 was legal in doubles

"obv theyre right sometimes, and there are no bad matchups, but talk about WHY or maybe at least talk about whats happening in the match."
i feel like so many smash commentators with no actual indepth knowledge just go on and on about how terrible every matchup / char but fox is
Anyone know who I can speak to in order to get my own stat thingy for melee? If possible for Dolphin?` @smashgg
oo
Call it confidence or arrogance but I keep wanting to rip the controller out of their hands and show em how it's done.
Last year when I couldn't compete much I learned how to just enjoy watching tournaments. Now I'm back to getting frustrated again lmao

But don't let this phantom hit make you forget that a marth player in 2017 grabbed a Fox on FD and chose not to up throw

"Car ride to Chicago, ramen break, then catch my flight home!"
Tldr smash reddit/twitter is filled with selfish entitled fuqs with no empathy and I'm stupid for caring. Will stop reading &amp; focus on melee
"Feels bad to have relax one tournament and now suddenly ""I don't act like a professional"" and apparantly I have the worst mentality...:("
"Tried my ass off for every tournament since I got my visa back, even when I was rusty, taking several tough loses just to get good asap."
"I went last minute, stuff unfortunately came up that had me stressed out and despite not feeling like playing I tried to for you guys."
"While I understand that people want to see us play, I can't stand the entitlement and getting personally blamed for top 8 ""being boring""."
"Spring has always been weak for smash/esports, Full Bloom literally blew up cuz people just wanted to play. Sucks what happened but still."
"After seeing how much more blame/hate that me/mango got for playing half assed, I'm just gonna drop like Armada/Hbox (fps/eglx &amp; beast)"
We had two unfortunate weekends with top 6 players droppin out/sandbagging and now everyone is overreacting to hell &amp; back -_-
Someone sponsor duck plz
Jesus fucking christ duck
Hbox is inspiring
Duck and Hboxs spacing Kreygasm
Lets fucking go @ssbDuck
Learned a lot about myself and what I need in order to fix my mindset and perform at my peak. I love how bluntly melee teaches you shit haha
"Can't wait to get home, deal with my personal issues‚Ñ¢, recharge and prep to go hardcore the rest of this spring &amp; summer to make up for it!"
"Sorry to everyone who supports me and wanted something different, I know I got your hopes up and after Mango @ FPS I understand if ur upset."
"There's just no real point in me using him atm, my fox covers all matchups really. Maybe in the future!"
"Wish I could live another life where I mained Marth instead, he's really fun and despite very little practice he comes so naturally to me."
"Wait, that was streamed? LOL then why call it recording setup"
Lost last game vs Sfat with Marth! Finally time to sleep üò∂
Uh eh nvm ppl want me to play gonna finish this half assed tournament by playing marth vs SFAT on recording setup LOL
"It's my own fault, knowing that I had other shit on my mind I shouldnt have gone to a one day tournament and half assed it. Sorry again!"
"Forfeit my losers match, really stressed/tired to wait for losers to catch up. Should really have stayed home lmao. Cya all next tournament!"
"Sorry if people are angry at me for not playing seriously or whatever, I really wanted to go marth but honestly too tired to play that MU"
Best marth combo of my LIFE
I'm too selfish to play for others LOL
Top 32 is starting soon!
"Never played for anyone else but myself before, I'll see how it feels hehe"
Going to try to play fox simply because I feel like its my duty &gt;_&gt;. If I'm not feeling it though im just gonna cop out and play marth :v
Ya boi does not know which character to play
ICYMI :I do not do signatures/selfies during 1 day tournaments :( possibly after depending on when it finishes!
"Pools soon, going to try out Fox and see how I feel, no promises tho!"
"Hax's side to the article. Not saying I agree with it, but its being removed from Reddit and its worth  a watch."
"On another note, new YT vid is up! Highlights from the previous netplay tournament, next on is next saturday!"
"Felt like my marth played amazing considering this is the first time I play him in teams, but our teamwork needs improvement!"
"Out of teams, lost close sets 3-1 to moon and swedish, and last stock 3-2 to shroomed/s2j! Marth is really fun in teams :)"
Ah man to play Marth or Fox arghh. Think I'm gonna marth it up for teams and then I'll see for singles bracket in 6 hours ~_~
"ROFL what in the world is full blooms ""reseeding"" oh boy cant wait"
"I really don't feel like half assing when I play fox, id much rather play marth etc then, but I also don't want Hbox to get a freebie :/"
"Part of it is just me lovin marth, hes sooooo fun"
"I'll see how tired/motivated I am by bracket time, no mango and no pewfat for teams + other personal issues (TM) might make me go marth"
Maaaan. Marth?
It's simply going to be more of an endurance test with lots of bad melee and no breaks. I'm just gonna see it as a serious side event tbh.
"For real though I really wish it wasn't a one day, playing all of teams at 11AM and then playing a full top 32 bo5 at 7PM into top 8......"
Ice just realized Full Bloom is a one day tournament

I am sure looking forward to escaping @ArmadaUGS Uthrow - Dsmash on my new Frankenstein Controller(TM)
"my internet stopped working, did a ""network reset""  thru the diagnose tool, restarted computer and now it doesnt recognize my second screen."
So sticks and Modded Gamecube controllers with both a control stick and digital input will essentially be strictly better....
Only having digital inputs could come with its own problem (that could be solved eventually) but the B0XX will also have an analog stick.
"Digital Input is always going to be very  different than analog, thats whats really shown here. I think the possible advantages are HUGE."
Please don't take my video as law on how the intricate inputs of melee work.First and foremost I wanted to start a discussion on the subject
".@Iaregravy I've always said heavily modded GCCs are the problem, I mean look at your results LOL. You're getting a lil desperate sweetie :)"
".@Iaregravy uh, what? I have ordered a controller from Kadano thats not even notch modded, but I havent got it and the one I use has no mods"

if any controller modders are down to prove a point for money pm me.

"""Summit talk"" in the title is one of my biggest turnoffs man"
Crouch canceling lab results: everyone else is stupid
lan ets mini celebration and labbing Crouch canceing because everyone else sucks
this along with tophs/blurs blatant bias and blame for g4 crews really makes me feel like the villain of the scene again. good to be back.
the games i lost were to a top 25 player in his best matchup and to 4 wobbles and yet everyone seems to think I played awful this tournament
during lan ets i won every single game but 1 with more than 2 stocks left. lost 3 close games. result=not a single compliment about my play.
i sat down on my bed and i cant move help
"hotel internet seems good actually, might do a lil celebration stream in a bit :)"
"Definitely got some good practice this weekend, gotta get grind a lot for next weekend though"
"Oh and Kk has crazy combos D: reaction techchase is scary, gotta get better against it!"
"Woo i won. Played well most games this tournament but I wasn't as consistent as I wanted, def need to work on my sheik matchup!"
"In GFs! Not as comfortable vs sheik as I want yet, gonna try to clean it up for GFs"
every top players ive asked about this doesnt actually seem to know what theyre talking about from just testing things really quickly
"is there any frame data for crouch canceling? what aerials are not punishable by say, peach/samus dsmash and does % change it (not pushback)"
Best hangover food ever
after party was l i t
Headed to the LAN ets after party soon :0
"Gotta play that matchup more for sure, not a matchup you can afford being rusty in :e"
"Aight qualified for top 8 woo Dropped a game (3-1) to an ics players, got wobbled 4 times hehe"
Bracket time :0
"also please stop ""but uh it was better in the manga"".  The anime is its own thing, and such be rated as such. source material is irrelevant."
"most episodes in the middle are MUCH better if you watch them sped up honestly, the show is downright offensive in how it much overexplains"
id honestly recommend most non shonen fanboys to just start watching at chimera ant arc and read summaries for earlier arcs + watch it at 2x
"wouldve made way way more sense to have it be killua/kurapika or someone, you pretty much instantly knew kites job was to die for the plot."
"i found gon's relationship/reaction with kite so hilariously over dramatic, he barely knew the guy, and he got deathflagged super early."
"most characters that make up 98% of screen time were introduced in the arc itself, while other character are just inexplicably missing."
"honestly though, the arc is so different and standalone from the rest of the series that it doesnt ""payoff"" the rest and just feels weird."
"oh yeah, hxh update: finished chimera ant arc, easily best arc so far altho still had some issues  (PACING!). one of the better shonen arcs."
"whew, just got done playing a lot of meleeee 1st in doubles and in singles pools, bracket in 2¬Ω hours :d"
"Here at LAN ETS!  If you wanna play me 1v1 get over here to the stage, starting 10:30 (in 20 minutes!)"

gengu god is back
"Going to sleep now, will read responses tomorrow. To the ""stfu just focus on smash"". I'm a human being with empathy 1st, player 2nd."
"I probably live in a bit of an echo chamber, and i dont know enough republicans, im just honestly genuinely curious how you defend this one."
I try to stay away from politics in general but I really don't think you can just ignore and stay silent for things this extreme.
"The sadest thing will always be that this isnt some evil dictator doing shit, its that people still support and voted for him and for this."
But hey hold on just a minute dont forget about the emails!!!!

I am so jetlagged that i have been sleeping for both swedish and american timezones
Turns out my sleep schedule is fucked
fyi fans the canon is big leff = when im in america  yung leff = when im degen in sweden
still can't quite grip how far ive come just because of this 15 year old video game.
looking at pictures of the huge genesis 4 crowd o-o i remember when I was nervous presenting shit in front of my class in school lmao
after I came home yday I slept like 17 hours had the most amazing weird dream holy moley
couldnt sleep during my long ass flight found some sick melee tech instead worth
"anyway, im done for now, maybe ill make a yt vid on it later."
"Though, I really hope they don't run melee as badly as they ran Smash 4 last year. A 2000ish man tournament in 2 days is incredibly risky."
"Melee is doing better than ever and we do NOT need EVO anymore. 2013 we did, but now its a worse tournament in a bigger arena."
"EVO is a tournament with ad breaks every 2 minutes, no analyst desk, no interviews, no friendly setups, bad bo5, bad seeding, no doubles."
"this is EVO's decision. I'm not telling you not to complain or to go despite it being saturday, but don't let it start a civil war."
"Don't blame the Smash 4 community, even if they're happy they got in, the majority also agree with you that Melee ""deserves"" it more."
"to me its just another decision by EVO that I heavily disagree with, not at all surprised. Will still be there to support the community."
"but yeah, I agree that melee easily deserves sunday, but more importantly I think its hilarious that they refuse to put both smash games."
"personally don't mind EVO having melee on saturday. we have better tournaments and this will stop people from calling it ""THE EVENT""."
"learned a lot from genesis, ill show you all soon."
"health and mentality will be my main focus going into beast 7.  gameplay is already up there, just need to keep grinding."
"Thanks to my fans for being so understanding this weekend, means a lot to me.  Here's a giveaway for you guys!"
"had a good time in san fransisco yesterday and today. Traveling for like 14 more hours or something. rest up a bit, then back on the grind."
Mango bought me a terrible 60 dollar dinner and call me a 4/10 that gets carried by hair and clothes FeelsBadMan
Melee has made it
Going inside the massive church is legit an amazing experience. Never felt so small. Also rainbow in the first picture PogChamp
.@redbullesports set me and the gods up in a fancy ass hotel in the middle in of San Fransisco.  Damn this view tho.
Taking care of wasted C9 Manuel
Here's @C9Mang0 's best kept secret.
Whos going to the foundry
Never going to forget this failure.
Shoutouts to the realest homies I hung out with tonight  You know who you are. Cya next time.
Wanted to throw my medal too but couldnt steal mangos moment
Swedish streak continues. Amazing stuff.
The writing is so obvious. 6/10 anime
Dont you fucking dare lose mango with all that plot armor
"Thanks for my fans and sponspors for all the support. Sorry I failed you. Anyway, time to enjoy some great melee. :)"
"Win or lose, I'm just so happy to be able to compete like this again. This time nerves got me, but I won't let it happen again. GGs"
Threw hard but cant be too mad with how fun that set was.
"Oh well killed the final meme, next up is either Armada or Mango. Guess I've got no choice but to become the storyline slayer as well."
Yeah man me vs axe is a total 50/50
"Awesome set, sad way to end it though. Do you see now how amazing doubles is?"
One more set
Can we just finish smash 64 on saturday and run melee teams top 8 instead? No offense but 64 does not deserve finals day over teams.
So everything is delayed by an hour right?
To win singles today I've gotta win 6 straight sets vs the best players in the world without dropping single one.  Bring it on.
"Time to rest up for tomorrow. Excited, first top 8 of 2017 - lets fucking go."
still need pika practice =(
"But uh, pika mains hit me up LOL"
"Playing Axe tomorrow. Hitting every single matchup I didnt get to practice god dangit lmao. Well, my practice will shine through eventually"
"Surprised I did that well vs ICs, hadnt had any high level practice in that matchup in a long time but it worked out."
"Made top 8. Not the way I wanted, but im proud of myself for improving my loser bracket mentality. Itll be important throughout 2017"
"Plup is amazing tho, cant wait to play him again asap"
"Its my B for not prepping properly, i was completely in fox samus mode and it got to me. Oh well, ill do my best in losers."
Couldnt play properly at all and plup went in. I hope I can waveshine combo my next opponent lmao
Beat 2 samuses woo
Oh and @Genesis_Smash im not playing on main stream as long as its version 1.00. Not playing an old patch.
"I wonder how many times ill have to say ""i dont do signatures/selfies/anything during bracket"" until people get it. Jesus christ."
Played like fucking garbage. Super dissappointed. Gonna have to step it up if I wanna stay in winners.
I may be the god slayer but am I the meme slayer? Watch me in the samus gauntlet coming to a stream near you
"In top 64 now. Playing good but nervous, hopefully I can pull myself together for the nightmare bracket"
"Lol so apparantly theres 2 different waves for next round of singles, so I play at 4 instead lf 2, welp"
Teams WF! Im so fucking good at 2v1
"Winner semis of teams, playing armada/android next."
"Nothing triggers me more than ""your problems doesnt matter because you play video games for a living""."
".@superlameworld Its about the fact that tournaments always delay the entire tournaments for those who sleep in, not 8am being that early."
Gonna be a loooooooong day
If teams doesnt start on time because they dont want to dq people ima be mad cuz waking up at 8am aint no joke
also motivated by all the undeserved hate i got today. fuck you.
first real tournament day of 2017 tomorrow - who knows what will happen. gonna do my best with what ive got and learn from there. excited.
".@kevinquach3 @aiurite Nope, 100/8 (8 crews) =12.5% chance. 300 dollars x 0.125 = 37.5 dollars  even with perfect balance teams its bad pay"
".@aiurite I'm against winner takes all payouts. By your argument, why have prize money at all for any tournament?"
crews took 8 hours hbox wizzy colbol abate and axe all fought hard and long and got 0 dollars each just like everyone who dropped out.
ayy
Livin that lavish sponsored life
BibleThump
havent felt like the villain in a long time i dropped out first and took the flame so everyone else could without getting flamed im batman
"Anyway, done talking now. Sorry if I disappointed you guys, but I gotta prioritize the tournament. I'll be more upfront about it next time."
".@SetchiSSBM of course, and I've already signed/taken selfies with 50ish people and more to come, but crews shouldnt be mandatory."
"Oh and just FYI - players aren't floated so they can play in crews, since crews was a compendium reward &amp; never guaranteed in the 1st place."
"again, remember that I cant do pictures/selfies tomorrow/sunday so get one today!"
Going to do some extra fan interaction with you guys later today as soon as Im done with my stuff. Got some free shit to hand out!
Remember when everyone started hating on Mango &amp; S2J for forfeiting teams and fucking the main tournaments seeding? Yeah me neither.
.@jacobvandevegte I wasn't promised to play so donating for me specifically is ??? &amp; the Staff still hasnt paid me for G3 compendium stuff.
".@Sflbrave ITS SEVEN HOURS. and No, I wasn't the reason crews was delayed."
"To be clear, I told my crew players ahead of time and I was NEVER asked about participating in crews &amp; made sure we had an alternate."
the main reason is I felt that I would rather lose than win (to make time to prep for teams/singles) and I never want to compete like that.
"I didn't play crews for several reasons (phone died - need to fix it, headache, switching hotel rooms, trying new controller etc) but -"
I was in the US for election day and now I'm here for inauguration day.   What a world.
"feeling pretty good about my play, just gotta hope that i can bring out my best in tournament since I havent played one since DPOTG."
