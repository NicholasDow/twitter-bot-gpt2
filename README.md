- tweets texts that I generated
- A twint script that helps downloads and processes tweets beyond 3200 api rate limit that twitter put in place since the election
- Collected tweets from accounts that I thought would make for good generation

# To DO

Work on the twitter stream so that you auto follow accounts that mention specific key words and have fewwer than 1000 followers

When your account follows them, give them a certain amount of time to follow you back.

If they don't follow you in the time span then un follow them and blacklist them on the following command

I would like to be able to train tweet generation on geographic locations pretaining to specific topics rather than particular users. I wonder if anything funny can come out of that. I think that I will see if collecting tweets from around comedy bars after 7pm on weekends will produce a generator that makes funny things.

I would also like to generate tweets for the average harvard student. I will collect geo tweets from leverett once the pandemic is over
